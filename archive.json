That may be the simpler case as it just comes down to LAG provisioning in the router, which an IP management system (\"controller\") should be able to do. One \"IP link\" over a LAG then maps to serveral transport services (e.g., ETH or OTN).\r\n\r\nI think there are some optical transport devices with Ethernet switching capabilities, and such optical devices may be able to implement a LAG in the transport network, too.

Adding LAG after the IP link is setup is a quite disruptive process. The scenario to add LAG after the IP link is setup is a niche use case\r\n\r\nAgreement to mention the option but not to describe it in details",

          "body": "I am aware of a lot of business value just by the discovery use case only. In think there are network operators who only care about discovery. In their use case, there is no need for any automated provisioning action. In other words, the reason for topology discovery is NOT to provision an IP link.\r\nThe typical example is IP/optical alarm correlation. And this is is not the only use case for which only discovery matters.\r\n\r\nBTW, discovery can be useful even if the DWDM network is relatively static and does not allow a lot of automation in the opical network (e.g., due to lack of ROADMs). In that case, the transport network can hardly automate IP link provisioning. Still, the IP/optical topology correlation may be very useful for network operation.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I found the original use case list starting with case 1 \"discovery\" much closer to what operators may deploy, also from a timing perspective. Many operators who currently run entirely isolated IP and transport networks would probably start with a \"discovery\" use case as a first step, e.g., within 1-2 years from now. Automating IP link/LAG provisioning may sound like research to such an operator, i.e., it may be 3-5 years in the future for them.\r\n\r\nI think many operators would just deploy a discovery solution as a first step in a production network, and then possibly grow from there. Having a dedicated use case 1 for the first step would reflect that. But, well, I am an academic now and I can't speak for operators ;-)",

          "body": "What exactly is meant by \"L2/L3VPN/VN Service Request by the Customer\"? The issues I have with the headline are:\r\n\r\n1. I can set-up a L3VPN from home without asking my carrier for permission, worst case some firewall entries in my home gateway need to be tweaked. So most likely 2.1 is meant as Carrier administered VPN.  \"Service request by the customer\" is at least misleading in this case. If it is a Carrier service it should be spelled out. how about renaming it \"L2/L3VPN/VN carrier service\" \r\n2. An observation: L2 services (EPL, EVPL) are usually provided over the Internet, so an EPL/EVPL becomes in effect a L3 service. That doesn't fit very well in a layered model. If an L2 service is supposed to be limited to native Ethernet switched services over transport (excluding IP/MPLS) then we better take a note going forward.\r\n3. Services provided over the Internet do not necessarily have a bandwidth associated. Are those meant to be included in the term \"L2/L3VPN/VN \" or is some bandwidth guarantee implicitly implied? If that's the case we may want to call it \"L2/L3VPN/VN carrier service with bandwidth guarantee\" \r\n4. Another observation: L3VPN services over the internet can have end-points in different networks. By limiting the scope to carrrier provisioned VPN one could argue that both ends stay within an administrative domain. \r\n\r\nin summary: if the intention is to cover all VPN/VN services defined by IETF and break them down in different use cases 2.1 should probably renamed \"L1/L2/L3 VPN services\". Else, if the scope is more limited e.g. covering carrier provisioning and bandwidth guarantee, it would make sense to indicate it directly in 2.1 e.g. something like \"L2/L3VPN/VN carrier service with bandwidth guarantee to not create false associations.",

          "body": "I am also confused by the focus on \"L2/L3VPN/VN Service Request by the Customer\".\r\n\r\nI agree with Gert that in particular L3VPNs seem like an open-ended area. For instance, L3VPNs with Inter-AS Options A, B, C can span multiple carriers. Traffic engineering across several AS is an interesting problem, but by and large orthogonal to optical DWDM systems - at least as far as I understand. Also, keep in mind that a L3VPN may run over a L2VPN and there is not a single \"customer\" in this case. It is a complex layered system...\r\n\r\nAnd I don't understand how the ToC reflects the following (simpler) bandwidth-on-demand scenario: A carrier observes that the bandwith of an MPLS LSP has to increase, e.g., by adding an IP link or growing a LAG. He needs a new lambda in the DWDM layer for that. How does this use case fit into the ToC? Is this not POI?\r\n\r\nAnd, well, I believe that increasing the bandwidth of an MPLS LSP or an IP link used by MPLS/IP can be required without any IP-based L3VPN/L2VPN \"customer\" service request. For instance, this can just be required if the routing in MPLS/IP changes as part of the normal network operation, e.g., to optimize the IP traffic distribution (or maintenance and the like).\r\n\r\nAt least in earlier days the use cases listed at https://sedonasys.com/ were sort of a reference to those in industry dealing with POI. It is a bit difficult to map this list of use cases to the proposed ToC.",

          "body": "Below is my proposed wording for an introduction, from the point of a former product line manager in this space who had to bridge the gap between these two \"worlds\". I post the text here to facilitate a discussion.\r\n\r\n1.  Introduction\r\n\r\nPacket Optical Integration (POI) is an advanced use case of traffic engineering. In wide area networks, a packet network based on the Internet Protocol (IP) and possibly Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is typically realized on top of an optical transport network that uses Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical networks are engineered and operated independently of each other. There are technical differences between the technologies (e.g., routers vs. optical switches) and the corresponding network engineering and planning methods (e.g., inter-domain peering optimization in IP vs. dealing with physical impairments in DWDM, or very different time scales). In addition, customers and customer needs can be different between a packet and an optical network, and it is not uncommon to use different vendors in both domains. Last but not least, state-of-the-art packet and optical networks use sophisticated but complex technologies, and for a network engineer it may not be trivial to be a full expert in both areas. As a result, packet and the optical network are often operated in technical and organizational silos.\r\n\r\nThis separation is inefficient for many reasons. Both capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operational expenditure (OPEX) could be significantly reduced by better integrating the packet and the opical network. Multi-layer topology insight can speed up troubleshooting (e.g., alarm correlation) and network operation (e.g., coordination of maintenance events), multi-layer topology inventory can improve service quality (e.g., detection of diversity constraint violations) and multi-layer traffic engineering can use the available network capacity more efficiently (e.g., coordination of restoration). In addition, provisioning workflows can be simplified or automated as needed across layers (e.g, to achieve bandwidth on demand).\r\n\r\nFully leveraging these benefits requires an integration between the management and control of the packet and the optical network. The Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) framework defines functions and interfaces between Multi-Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) and Provisioning Network Controller (PNC) that can be used for coordinating the packet and optical layers.\r\n\r\nIn this document, key use cases for Packet Optical Integration (POI) are described both from the point of view of the optical and the packet layer. The objective is explain the benefit and the impact for both the packet and the optical layer, and to identify the required interaction between both layers. Precide definitions of use cases can help with achieving a common understanding across different disciplines. The focus of the use cases are IP networks operated as client of optical DWDM networks. The use cases are ordered by increasing level of integration and complexity. For multi-layer each use case, the document analyzes how to use the interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture. Understanding the standardization and potential gaps helps to assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical layers, in particular in multi-vendor environments.",

          "body": "Hi Sergio,\r\n\r\nGood question. Indeed, it may be difficult to clearly distinguish both\r\ncases. But there is a subtle detail behind my wording:\r\n\r\nFirst, there are 'navigation' use cases in which one mainly performs\r\ntop-down or buttom-up navigation between the layers. This typically starts\r\nfrom some given entity. An example is to identify all 'IP links' over a\r\ngiven OTS link or ODU service. This is often an online operation as part of\r\na human workflow in the NOC.\r\n\r\nSecond, there are use cases for 'analysis' operations running over the\r\nwhole multi-layer topology inventory database. These can be batch processes\r\nrunning offline and generating reports (e.g. over night). In that case, the\r\noperation is not triggered by an engineer.\r\n\r\nMaybe one could add some words (say, 'online' vs. 'offline') to better\r\nexplain that. For sure, it is a subtle difference and one could also merge\r\nthem, albeit they are quite different to the user of the solution.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nsergiobelotti <notifications@github.com> schrieb am Mi., 23.

Understanding which IP services run on the MPLS LSPs is by and large an IP-only problem orthogonal to POI - at least to me.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that the numbers of IP services over a single MPLS LSP can be huge, and an MDSC that knows all IP services in a bigger IP network may have to understand hundreds of thousands of IP services, or even more. At least to my understanding, scalability needs to be considered from day one when discussion awareness of IP services.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would suggest to first focus on \"IP links\", IGP adjacencies, and MPLS LSPs on routers.

The bit rate parameters will determine the Baud-rate, the modulation forma, the FEC etc.\r\nThe controller, to set a TXP Client connection, needs to fine a DWDM circuit suitable to comply the DWDM port parameters.\r\nDifferent is when the Client connection is using a Muxponder port (e.g. 10GE).  In the MXP configuration there is a one to many relationship between the MXP DWDM port (Trunk) and the client ports, foe example there might be a 100Gb/s trunk port shared by then 100GE client ports.   The controller asked to set a 10GE Client connection between two MXP ports needs then to check whether there already is a DWDM connection (or OTSi) between the two MXP and then take actions:\r\n1) if there is the OTSi connection then the controller needs only to enable the 10GE client ports (matching the number or assigning to them a proper time slot into the OTSi) and espablish the 10GE connection.  It needs to be noted that in MXPs usually the client ports are assigned to the time slots by default (or by design).\r\n2) if there is NOT an OTSi connection between the two MXP the controller has to first establish the DWDM connection finding a proper circuit matching the Trunk transceiver optical parameters (e.g. OTSi carrying a OTU4).  Once the circuit is established the controller can enable the 100GE client ports and set the 10GE end to end service. ",

The multi-layer optimisation can be triggered by MDSC during L3 VPN creation but this can be independently done.

          "body": "Suggested text...\r\n\r\n>>\r\nEarlier in the document, LLDP is discussed as a mechanism for the PNCs to discover the intra-domain Ethernet and IP links. While LLDP provides valuable information for network management and troubleshooting, it also presents several security issues:\r\n\r\no Eavesdropping: LLDP transmissions are not encrypted. Potentially, LLDP packets could be captured using a packet sniffer. An attacker can leverage this information to gain insights into the network topology, device types, and configurations, which could be used for further attacks;\r\n\r\no Unauthorized Access: Information disclosed by LLDP can include device types, software versions, and network configuration details. This might help an attacker identify vulnerable devices or configurations that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges within the network;\r\n\r\no Data Manipulation: If an attacker gains access to a network device, they could manipulate LLDP information to advertise false device information, leading to potential misconfigurations or trust relationships being exploited. This can disrupt network operations or redirect traffic to malicious devices;\r\n\r\no Denial of Service (DoS): By flooding the network with fake LLDP packets, an attacker could overwhelm network devices or management systems, potentially leading to a denial of service where legitimate network traffic is disrupted;\r\n\r\no Spoofing: An attacker could spoof LLDP packets to impersonate other network devices. Potentially, this might lead to incorrect network mappings or trust relationships being established with malicious devices;\r\n\r\no Lack of Authentication: LLDP does not include mechanisms for authenticating the source of LLDP messages, which means that devices accept LLDP information from any source as legitimate. \r\n\r\nTo mitigate these security issues, network administrators might implement several security measures, including:\r\n\r\no Disabling LLDP on ports where it is not needed, especially those facing untrusted networks;\r\n\r\no Using network segmentation and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to limit who can send and receive LLDP packets;\r\n\r\no Employing network monitoring and anomaly detection systems to identify unusual LLDP traffic patterns that may indicate an attack;\r\n\r\no Regularly updating and patching network devices to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through information gathered via LLDP.\r\n<<",

It highlights how existing IETF protocols and data models may be used for multi-layer services. It reuses several existing IETF protocols and data models for the MPI interfaces between each PNC (Optical or Packet) and the MDSC, including:\r\n\r\n\u2022 RESTCONF\r\n\u2022 NETCONF\r\n\u2022 PCEP\r\n\u2022 YANG\r\n\r\nSeveral existing authentication and encryption practices and techniques may be used to help secure these MPI interfaces. These mechanisms include using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide secure transport for RESTCONF, NETCONF and PCEP. Furthermore, access control techniques can also provide additional security. NETCONF supports an Access Control Model (NACM), and RESCONF supports Role Based Access Control (RBAC), which should also ensure that MDSC to PNC communication is based on authorised use and granular control of connectivity and resource requests.\r\n<<\r\n\r\nI will continue to work on this text.

This document explores the need for automation in multi-layer transport networks, where a \u201clayer\u201d refers to a specific level of functionality within the network architecture and the term is further defined in [RFC4397]. Service providers can create a more efficient and scalable network infrastructure by automating the management and control of these layers, including the optical and microwave transport layers and the packet (IP/MPLS) layer. For instance, automating traffic routing across these layers can enable dynamic allocation of resources, ensuring optimal network performance for various applications.\r\n\r\nThis approach is particularly beneficial for Service Providers and large enterprises dealing with high bandwidth demands and looking for cost-effective ways to expand their networks.

Gabriele explained how this was done with UNI-GMPLS. Similarly O-PNC should perform the optical impairment validation and path computation for the new optical circuit and provides back to MDSC the list of SRLGs for this new optical circuit along with path (RRO), lambda, power etc.  MDSC then should be able to share these SRLGs with the P-PNC that will perform the SR-TE path computation for the new requested IP VPN service. If existing optical circuit is modified (e.g. after restoration) then O-PNC will notify MDSC of the new path characteristics (including new SRLGs) and MDSC will have to update the P-PNC that will act in consequence.\r\n\r\n- **option 3 we called \u201cFull knowledge\u201d**: Centralised MDSC gathers all information about optical networks underneath including SRLGs from O-PNCs and performs multi-layer path computation and then push the optical circuit request towards O-PNC and the end-to-end SR-TE path request and the L3VPN/L2VPN service binding towards the P-PNC. As commented by Gabriele, apart from possible scalability issues it is not likely that MDSC can perform the optical impairment validation and path computation. Today this is done by the O-PNC in conjunction with Vendor planning tool for a good accuracy. At MDSC level it would mean that all the Vendor information (all characteristics of their NEs along with their optical impairment algorithms) is shared with an open-source planning tool like GNPy for example.\r\n\r\nSergio mentioned that this topic of path computation between MDSC and O-PNC was discussed a lot in TEAS for generic model https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-teas-yang-path-computation\r\nand in CCAMP for the specific optical path computation model https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-gbb-ccamp-otn-path-computation-yang and \r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-gbb-ccamp-optical-path-computation-yang (which are currently polled for adoption as CCAMP WG drafts)",

Being able to deal with such a long list is an implementation issue and therefore outside the scope of the document.\r\n\r\nThe SRLG of an optical tunnel are reported by the O-PNC to the MDSC within the path-srlg-lists (computed-path-properties), for each path. In case the optical tunnel is configured with protection or restoration, the translation of the optical paths SRLG into IP link SRLG list is a matter of MDSC policy and the list of SRLGs configured by the MDSC to the P-PNC can also change dynamically when the optical path changes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12461741/194848861-5cb60a47-a6ae-4a9f-840e-3e8805834f84.png)\r\n",

This should not be an issue since the LAG group is configured by the MDSC.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to rely on other mechanisms (e.g., the Port type field in the Link Aggregation TLV defined in Annex F of IEEE 8012.1AX-2015) that allow the ROADM identify which LLDP packets have been transmitted on the LAG member (Aggregation Port) or on the LAG group (Aggregated Port).\r\n\r\n- [x] @italobusi : update the text in PR #90 accordingly\r\n",

One possibility is to do LSP stitching\r\n\r\nJeff: RSVP-TE end-to-end is not widely used in the network. Usually BGP-LU is used with RSVP-TE\r\n\r\nDaniele: there are two BGP extensions for multi-domain services which are better fitting when there is a need to map a service with an LSP: BGP-CT (classfull transport) and BGP-CAR (color-aware routing)\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dskc-bess-bgp-car-problem-statement/\r\n- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kaliraj-idr-bgp-classful-transport-planes/\r\n- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dskc-bess-bgp-car/\r\n\r\nWe can update the text to generalize RSVP-TE and SR-TE end-to-end descriptions even though the procedures will be most likely used for SR-TE end-to-end\r\n\r\nTo be discussed also with Brent next week and, if needed, we can trigger some more discussion on the TEAS WG mailing list regarding the proposal to generalize the description of RSVP-TE and SR-TE end-to-end, leaving the BGP-LU outside the scope of the document",

A data plane layer is associated with a region  however, more than one data plane layer can be associated with the same region (e.g., both VC4 and VC12 are associated with TDM).\r\nFor example in our case for Ethernet we can say that PHY and MAC data plane layers can be associated with the same ETH region.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "RFC 5212:\r\n> A switching type describes the ability of a node to forward data of a particular data plane technology, and uniquely identifies a network region.  A layer describes a data plane switching granularity level (e.g., VC4, VC-12).  A data plane layer is associated with a region in the control plane (e.g., VC4 is associated with TDM, MPLS is associated with PSC).  However, more than one data plane layer can be associated with the same region (e.g., both VC4 and VC12 are associated with TDM).  Thus, a control plane region, identified by its switching type value (e.g., TDM), can be sub-divided into smaller-granularity component networks based on \"data plane switching layers\".\r\n\r\nThe proposed alternatives in the table may be a little misleading.\r\n\r\n1. a PNC-domain is a domain of nodes that are provisioned by a single PNC. I.e. it is not uncommon that an operator has more than one optical-PNC in the network, typically based on some vendor choices. If one has a back-to-back connection between O1-PNC and O2-PNC, it is an inter-PNC-domain-link. \r\n2. PNC-domains are strictly related to control. O1-PNC and O2-PNC would be different control domains in the O-Region. The need for O1/O2/... controllers is not related to Layers but a choice made by operators in structuring the network.\r\n3. Layers follow the ITU-T layered model logic and are Transport plane related. To \"connect\" different layers, one needs model an adaptation function which is not part of a link. So a cross-layer-link is a control construct and would rather represent a cross-region-link. Similarly, G.800/G.7703/[RFC 8795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8795) defines \"transitional link\" as topological construct, not as a layer\r\n4. Any layered technology involves many layers, i.e. Ethernet is not a single layer, nor is OTN, WDM etc. The control logic is that switching happens on a specific layer (E.g. Ethernet MAC layer) and all lower layers need to be terminated to do so e.g. PHY, OPU,ODU,OTU,OCH (using old terminology here). So in simplified terms: the sum of devices operating (switching) on a specific technology is called \"region\".\r\n\r\n| OLD | Gert's proposal | Other alternatives (for further discussion) | commenting proposed alternatives\r\n|------|-------|-----|-\r\n| intra-domain-link | intra-PNC-domain | intra-domain (with proper clarification in the definition) |\r\n| inter-domain-link | inter-PNC-domain | inter-domain (with proper clarification in the definition) |  an O1-PNC-domain to O2-PNC-domain link would then be labeled \"inter-domain-link\"\r\n| cross-layer-link | cross-region | cross-domain | if \"domain\" is meant to be a PNC-domain, then cross-domain is the same as inter-domain. If the link connects regions, it would be an inter-region link.\r\n| single-layer-link | single-technology or single-region | single-hop | a hop is typically considered to  be between two devices of the same region.\r\n| multi-layer-link | inter-technology or inter-region | multi-hop | <- this term suggests multiple hops in the same region - is that the intention? \r\n\r\n",

The flexi-grid topology models allow different nominal central frequency granularity and slot width granularity values to co-exist within the same topology.\r\n\r\nJeff: CWDM networks are only for access and outside the scope of POI.

In case of ACTN, the P-PNC can expose its single-domain topology to the \r\nBGP and the MDSC can build the multi-domain topology view solely based on the topologies exposed by its underlay P-PNCs. The P-PNC can use BGP-LS to discover its domain topology. BGP-LS is typically used to convey the raw packet topology from a designated router/reflector to the P-PNC. That implies that using a YANG-specified NBI to the MDSC could benefit from abstracted/summarized/customized topology happening in the P-PNC,Pas opposed to a simple BGP-LS session.\r\n\r\nSince the mechanisms used by the P-PNC to discover the packet topology exposed to the MDSC are outside the scope of this draft, no changes are required to the document since these are just some among the possible mechanisms that the P-PNC can use.\r\n",

Attached the commented version.\r\n\r\nThere are the comments and my initial feedbacks:\r\n\r\n> 1. In draft-ietf-teas-actn-yang it seems to me that TE Service Mapping is at CMI level non MPI.In fact is working in companion with VN Yang model right?\r\n\r\nI think that draft-ietf-teas-actn-yang would need some update\r\nTSM is providing a mapping between L2NM/L3NM/L1CSM/L2SM/L3SM and VN/Tunnel/SR-policy:\r\n- TSM is used at the CMI to provide a mapping between L1CSM/L2SM/L3SN and VN\r\n- TSM can be used at the packet MPI to provide a mapping between L2NM/L3NM and Tunnel\r\n\r\n> 2. Do you mean by which model, interface ?\r\n\r\nYes, I think that the latest update has resolved the issue\r\n\r\n> 3. Reading 4.1.2 it seems the text is already aligned to both IP link discovery and link setup. Am I missed something in the text of the note?\r\n\r\nThis is one of the issue I am struggling with. With YANG, discovery and setup is done by writing or reading the same YANG model(s). However, section 4.1.2 should describe how the multi-layer IP link is discovered. For clarity in the latest draft, the content of section 4.1.2 has been moved to 4.2.3. We can later discuss what to write into section 4.1.2 (or whether to delete it).\r\n\r\n",

The text should be either generic or just be an example till the end.\r\n\r\nAgreement to review the text description\r\n\r\n2. we say that the MDSC always sends the explicit path to the P-PNC, but with big domains it may be beneficial to just provide a loose path and leave up to the P-PNC to figure out the detailed path\r\n\r\nMajor comments from Paolo:\r\n1. section 2.2 should be maintained but rewritten to clarify that SR-TE is used (related to Jeff's comment 2 above)\r\n\r\nAgreement is to keep section 2.2 and to align its content with the rest of the document\r\n\r\nThe key issue is about whether the MDSC needs to always configure an explicit path or whether it could specify a loose path\r\n\r\nAs discussed in section 2.1.2, with partial summarization the MDSC computes the complete path in the packet layer. This is required for the MDSC to understand whether there is a need or not to setup new optical tunnels and, if needed, which optical tunnels to request to O-PNCs.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no need for the MDSC to always specify the complete explicit path to the P-PNC when requesting the P-PNC to set the path up. If the MDSC specifies a loose path to the P-PNC, it is possible that the intra-domain path installed by P-PNC is different from the intra-domain path segment computed by the MDSC but, as long as the TE constraints are satisfied, this is acceptable.\r\n\r\nConsidering for example the SR-TE path between PE13 and PE23, the MDSC can compute the PE13-P15-BR11 - BR21-P24-PE23 path. In this case, the MDSC can request the P-PNC2 to setup the strict BR21-P24-PE23 path or a loose BR21-PE23 path. In the latter case, the P-PNC2 can setup a BR21-BR22-PE23 path instead of the BR21-P24-PE23 path computed by the MDSC.\r\n\r\nBandwidth allocation with RSVP-TE is performed by the routers; with SR-TE bandwidth allocation is not performed by the routers but by a controller. In our scenario, the controller can be either the P-PNC or the MDSC: in the draft it is assumed that it is the P-PNC.\r\n",

A further updated version of the slides has been uploaded on GitHub:\r\n\r\n[inter-domain-link-discovery-04.pptx](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8119535/inter-domain-link-discovery-04.pptx)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Gabriele: to prepare an ASCII version of slides 3, 5, 9 and, optionally, 7 for inclusion, as examples, in the draft\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: update the draft description referencing the examples in the slides\r\n\r\n#### SR-TE bandwidth\r\n\r\nThe current assumption is that P-PNC is responsible to configure the SR policies on the routers and to manage the bandwidth within its domain. There is therefore the need for a \"higher-level\" model, similar to the TE Tunnel model, between the MDSC and the P-PNC.\r\n\r\nThe draft assumes that the TE Tunnel model is used since it already provides the concepts of paths, path constraints and bandwidth. However same gaps have been already identified: lack of multiple paths and lack of SR-TE technology attributes.\r\n\r\nIn section 4.2.3, it is said that the MDSC configures TI-LFA for a given SR-TE path. However, TI-LFA is pre-configured by the P-PNC for local protection, independently from the SR-TE paths. An unprotected adjacency SID can be used if TI-LFA local protection is not required.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Brent: to provide some text for section 4.2.3 about the protection options: to be further discussed whether to place this text in section 4.2.3 or in section 2.2.2\r\n\r\n#### LLDP: Chassis ID versus System Name TLVs\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: update the text to clarify that:\r\n  - routers and optical NEs should report all the relevant LLDP information (including System Name is used)\r\n  - the encoding of the LLDP information is implementation-specific, but the encoding rules need to be consistent across all the PNCs. The suggestion is to encode the Chassis ID and Port ID since they are mandatory TLVs.\r\n\r\n#### Explicit path configuration\r\n\r\n- [ ] Paolo: to discuss offline via mail some text proposal for section 2.2\r\n\r\n#### Who configures IP links: P-PNC, MDSC or either (on a case-by-case)\r\n\r\nSingle-layer intra-domain IP link could be configured by the P-PNC and reported to the MDSC or by the MDSC. The drawback of the first option is that we can have different work-flows depending on whether the links are intra-domain versus inter-domain or single-layer versus multi-layer\r\n\r\nFabio: today the single-layer intra-domain IP links are configured by the P-PNC\r\n\r\n- [ ] Jeff: get some feedbacks\r\n\r\nSingle-layer inter-domain IP link could be configured by P-PNCs with some offline negotiation or by MDSC.\r\n\r\nMulti-layer intra-domain IP link could be configured by the P-PNC or by the MDSC.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Continue discussion of this issue offline\r\n\r\n#### Additional comments\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: Update the reference to L3NM draft with a reference to RFC9182\r\n\r\nIt would be better to keep L3-TE Topo at the P-PNC MPI.\r\n\r\nHowever, further investigation is needed since L3-TE Topo does not seem needed for SR-TE topology but it may be useful if also IP/MPLS is supported in addition to SR-TE. The draft describes the models which at least are needed to support the analyzed scenarios so it does not preclude having other models (e.g., L3-TE Topo), if needed for other scenarios.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: check with TEAS experts about L3-TE Topo for SR-TE\r\n",

[x] Jeff: get some feedbacks from IP dept\r\n\r\n> - [x] Continue discussion of this issue offline\r\n\r\nConclusion from offline discussion:\r\n- Update the draft assuming that the intra-domain IP links are always configured by the P-PNC\r\n- Describe the implications of this assumption:\r\n  - MDSC receives a request to setup a L2/L3 VPN service\r\n  - MDSC understands that in order to fulfill this service requests it needs to setup a new optical tunnel (to support the setup of a new IP link)\r\n  - MDSC requests the O-PNC to setup the optical tunnel\r\n  - After the optical tunnel has been successfully setup, MDSC waits for the P-PNC to configure the new IP link\r\n     - After the new optical tunnel has been setup, the P-PNC may automatically discovers the new adjacency (e.g., through LLDP) and configures the new IP link.\r\n     - Alternatively, the MDSC may configure the new intra-domain Ethernet link and the P-PNC can then configure the new IP link.\r\n  - After the P-PNC has setup the new IP link, the MDSC requests the P-PNC to setup a new SR-TE path or re-route an existing SR-TE path through the new IP link\r\n    - The MDSC will get notified that the new IP link has been setup by the P-PNC by a topology update of the SR-TE topology exposed by the P-PNC\r\n- Discuss this issue during the TEAS WG session at IETF 113 to get feedbacks from the WG\r\n- Track this as a new open issue (*TBD*) in github to be resolved by IETF 114, taking into account the feedbacks from IETF 113 discussion\r\n- The configuration of the inter-domain IP links does not involve any multi-layer coordination and therefore can be considered outside the scope of this document\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: Update the text to align with this conclusion\r\n\r\nOpen issue #81 has been created to track the discussion at IETF 113\r\n\r\n#### Terminology: router port versus Ethernet interface\r\n\r\nSummary of offline discussion:\r\n- Use the term \u201cport\u201d to represent the physical entity and the term \u201cinterface\u201d to entities which can be logical\r\n- Describe the router configuration (if needed) as:\r\n  - without LAG: : an Ethernet port (physical) supporting an Ethernet interface supporting an IP interface\r\n  - with LAG: a set of Ethernet ports (physical) each one supporting an Ethernet interface and all supporting a LAG interface (logical) supporting an IP interface (logical)\r\n- Describe the optical NE configuration (if needed) as:\r\n  - an Ethernet port (physical) supporting an Ethernet interface\r\n- A link is an association between two interfaces that can exchange traffic directly\r\n  - An Ethernet link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces\r\n  - An IP link is a link between two IP interfaces\r\n- Define the following links:\r\n  - a cross-layer (Ethernet) link is an Ethernet link between an Ethernet interface on the router and an Ethernet interface on the optical NE, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these router and optical NE;\r\n  - an intra-domain single-layer Ethernet link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces on adjacent routers, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these adjacent routers\r\n  - an intra-domain single-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces on adjacent routers, supported by an intra-domain single-layer Ethernet link\r\n  - an inter-domain single-layer Ethernet link is an Ethernet link between two Ethernet interfaces on adjacent routers, which belong to different P-PNC domains, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these adjacent routers\r\n  - an inter-domain single-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces on adjacent routers, which belong to different P-PNC domains, supported by an inter-domain single-layer Ethernet link\r\n  - an intra-domain multi-layer ETH link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces supported by two cross-layer links and an optical tunnel\r\n  - an intra-domain multi-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces, supported by an intra-domain multi-layer ETH link\r\n- Consider the concept of a LAG link supported by multiple ETH links (to be discussed whether only intra-domain single-layer or also of other types when LAG scenarios are added to the draft)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: include these definitions in the draft\r\n\r\n#### Additional comments\r\n\r\n> - [x] Italo: Update the reference to L3NM draft with a reference to RFC9182\r\n\r\nLatest text in PR #69 updated accordingly\r\n\r\n> - [x] Italo: check with TEAS experts about L3-TE Topo for SR-TE\r\n\r\nA new open issue #85 has been created (target IETF 114)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: update section 2.3 for consistency with section 2.2\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: renumber section 4.1 and 4.2 as sections 4 and 5 (leaving room for some sub-sections)\r\n\r\n- [ ] Italo: move around some text in section 4.2 to improve the flow of the description\r\n",

I have only one comment in section 2.2 where we have the new proposed text: \"In general, with reference to figure 3, a bidirectional SR-TE path from PE13 in domain 1 to PE23 in domain 2 (...)\" and we describe then SR-TE configuration steps with P-PNC1 and PNC2 for the end-to-end SR-TE path (both directions). Why did you put \"In general\" instead of \"For example\" that was stated before? Guess that each time we refer to SR-TE we should mention it is just as example now, right?",
