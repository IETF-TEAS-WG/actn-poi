     Abstract 

        This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and Control 
        of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration 
        (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and optical internetworking. It 
        identifies the YANG data models defined by the IETF to support this 
        deployment architecture and specific scenarios relevant to Service 
        Providers. 

        Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each 
        multi-layer (packet over optical) scenario with a specific focus on 
        the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network 
        Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.

     1. Introduction 

        The complete automation of the management and control of Service 
        Providers transport networks (IP/MPLS, optical, and microwave 
        transport networks) is vital for meeting emerging demand for high-
        bandwidth use cases, including 5G and fiber connectivity services. 
        The Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture and 
        interfaces facilitate the automation and operation of complex optical 
        and IP/MPLS networks through standard interfaces and data models. 
        This allows a wide range of network services that can be requested by 
        the upper layers fulfilling almost any kind of service level 
        requirements from a network perspective (e.g. physical diversity, 
        latency, bandwidth, topology, etc.)

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        Packet Optical Integration (POI) is an advanced use case of traffic 
        engineering. In wide-area networks, a packet network based on the 
        Internet Protocol (IP), and often Multiprotocol Label Switching 
        (MPLS) or Segment Routing (SR), is typically realized on top of an 
        optical transport network that uses Dense Wavelength Division 
        Multiplexing (DWDM)(and optionally an Optical Transport Network 
        (OTN)layer). 

        In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical 
        networks are engineered and operated independently. As a result, 
        there are technical differences between the technologies (e.g., 
        routers compared to optical switches) and the corresponding network 
        engineering and planning methods (e.g., inter-domain peering 
        optimization in IP, versus dealing with physical impairments in DWDM, 
        or very different time scales). In addition, customers needs can be 
        different between a packet and an optical network, and it is not 
        uncommon to use other vendors in both domains. The operation of these 
        complex packet and optical networks is often siloed, as these 
        technology domains require specific skill sets.  

        The packet/optical network deployment and operation separation are 
        inefficient for many reasons. First, both capital expenditure (CAPEX) 
        and operational expenditure (OPEX) could be significantly reduced by 
        integrating the packet and the optical networks. Second, multi-layer 
        online topology insight can speed up troubleshooting (e.g., alarm 
        correlation) and network operation (e.g., coordination of maintenance 
        events), and multi-layer offline topology inventory can improve 
        service quality (e.g., detection of diversity constraint violations). 
        Third, multi-layer traffic engineering can use the available network 
        capacity more efficiently (e.g., coordination of restoration). In 
        addition, provisioning workflows can be simplified or automated 
        across layers (e.g., to achieve bandwidth-on-demand or to perform 
        activities during maintenance windows). 

        This document uses packet-based Traffic Engineered (TE) service 
        examples. These are described as "TE-path” in this document. Unless 
        otherwise stated, these TE services may be instantiated using RSVP-
        TE-based or SR-TE-based, forwarding plane mechanisms. 

        The ACTN framework enables the complete multi-layer and multi-vendor 
        integration of packet and optical networks through a Multi-Domain 
        Service Coordinator (MDSC), and packet and optical Provisioning 
        Network Controllers (PNCs). 

        This document describes critical scenarios for POI from the packet 
        service layer perspective and identifies the required coordination

        between packet and optical layers to improve POI deployment and 
        operation. These scenarios focus on multi-domain packet networks 
        operated as a client of optical networks.  

        This document analyses the case where the packet networks support 
        multi-domain TE paths. The optical networks could be either a DWDM 
        network, an OTN network (without DWDM layer), or a multi-layer 
        OTN/DWDM network. Furthermore, DWDM networks could be either fixed-
        grid or flexible-grid. 

        Multi-layer and multi-domain scenarios, based on the reference 
        network described in section 2 and very relevant for Service 
        Providers, are described in sections 4 and 5. 

        For each scenario, existing IETF protocols and data models, 
        identified in sections 3.1 and 3.2, are analysed with a particular 
        focus on the MPI in the ACTN architecture. 

        For each multi-layer scenario, the document analyzes how to use the 
        interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture. 

        A summary of the gaps identified in this analysis is provided in 
        section 6. 

        Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps will 
        help assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical 
        DWDM domains (and optionally OTN layer) in an end-to-end multi-vendor 
        service provisioning perspective. 

     1.1. Terminology 

        This document uses the ACTN terminology defined in [RFC8453] 

        In addition, this document uses the following terminology. 

        Customer service: 

          the end-to-end service from CE to CE 

        Network service: 

          the PE to PE configuration, including both the network service 
          layer (VRFs, RT import/export policies configuration) and the

          configuration (on the PE side) of the interface towards the CE 
          (e.g. VLAN, IP adress, routing protocol etc.)

        The ACTN architecture, defined in [RFC8453], is used to control this 
        multi-layer and multi-domain network where each Packet PNC (P-PNC) is 
        responsible for controlling its packet domain and where each Optical 
        PNC (O-PNC) in the above topology is responsible for controlling its 
        optical domain. The packet domains controlled by the P-PNCs can be 
        Autonomous Systems (ASes), defined in [RFC1930], or IGP areas, within 
        the same operator network. 

        The routers between the packet domains can be either AS Boundary 
        Routers (ASBR) or Area Border Router (ABR): in this document, the 
        generic term Border Router (BR) is used to represent either an ASBR 
        or an ABR. 

        The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain 
        multi-layer (packet and optical) network. A specific standard 
        interface (MPI) permits MDSC to interact with the different 
        Provisioning Network Controller (O/P-PNCs).  

        The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to MDSC, hiding 
        technology-specific aspects of the network and hiding topology 
        details depending on the policy chosen regarding the level of 
        abstraction supported. The level of abstraction can be obtained based 
        on P-PNC and O-PNC configuration parameters (e.g., provide the 
        potential connectivity between any PE and any BR in a packet 
        network). 

        In the reference network of Figure 1, it is assumed that: 

        o  The domain boundaries between the packet and optical domains are 
           congruent. In other words, one optical domain supports 
           connectivity between routers in one and only one packet domain; 

        o  There are no inter-domain physical links between optical domains. 
           Inter-domain physical links exist only: 

            o between packet domains (i.e., between BRs belonging to 
               different packet domains): these links are called inter-domain 
               Ethernet or IP links within this document; 

            o between packet and optical domains (i.e., between routers and 
               optical NEs): these links are called cross-layer links within 
               this document; 

            o between customer sites and the packet network (i.e., between 
               CE devices and PE routers): these links are called access 
               links within this document.

        o  All the physical interfaces at inter-domain links are Ethernet 
           physical interfaces. 

        Although the new optical technologies (e.g., QSFP-DD ZR 400G) allow 
        the operators to provide DWDM pluggable interfaces on the routers, 
        the deployment of those pluggable optics is not yet widely adopted. 
        The reason is that most operators are not yet ready to manage packet 
        and optical networks in a single unified domain. Therefore, a unified 
        use case analysis is outside this draft's scope. 

        This document analyses scenarios where all the multi-layer IP links, 
        supported by the optical network, are intra-domain (intra-AS/intra-
        area), such as PE-BR, PE-P, BR-P, P-P IP links. Therefore the inter-
        domain IP links are always single-layer links supported by Ethernet 
        physical links. 

        The analysis of scenarios with multi-layer inter-domain IP links is 
        outside the scope of this document. 

        Therefore, if inter-domain links between the optical domains exist, 
        they would be used to support multi-domain optical services, which 
        are outside the scope of this document. 

        The optical network elements (NEs) within the optical domains can be 
        ROADMs or OTN switches, with or without an integrated ROADM function. 

     2.1. Multi-domain Service Coordinator (MDSC) functions 

        The MDSC in Figure 1 is responsible for multi-domain and multi-layer 
        coordination across multiple packet and optical domains and provides 
        multi-layer/multi-domain L2/L3 VPN network services requested by an 
        OSS/Orchestration layer. 

        From an implementation perspective, the functions associated with 
        MDSC described in [RFC8453] may be grouped differently. 

        1. The service- and network-related functions are collapsed into a 
          single, monolithic implementation, dealing with the end customer 
          service requests received from the CMI (Customer MDSC Interface) 
          and adapting the relevant network models. An example is represented 
          in Figure 2 of [RFC8453]. 
        2. An implementation can choose to split the service-related and the 
          network-related functions into different functional entities, as 
          described in [RFC8309] and in section 4.2 of [RFC8453]. In this 
          case, MDSC is decomposed into a top-level Service Orchestrator, 
          interfacing the customer via the CMI, and into a Network

          Orchestrator interfacing at the southbound with the PNCs. The 
          interface between the Service Orchestrator and the Network 
          Orchestrator is not specified in [RFC8453]. 
        3. Another implementation can choose to split the MDSC functions 
          between an "higher-level MDSC" (MDSC-H) responsible for packet and 
          optical multi-layer coordination, interfacing with one Optical 
          "lower-level MDSC" (MDSC-L), providing multi-domain coordination 
          between the O-PNCs and one Packet MDSC-L, providing multi-domain 
          coordination between the P-PNCs (see for example Figure 9 of 
          [RFC8453]). 
        4. Another implementation can also choose to combine the MDSC and the 
          P-PNC functions. 

        In the current service provider’s network deployments, at the North 
        Bound of the MDSC, instead of a CNC, typically, there is an 
        OSS/Orchestration layer. In this case, the MDSC would implement only 
        the Network Orchestration functions, as in [RFC8309] described in 
        point 2 above. Therefore, the MDSC deals with the network services 
        requests received from the OSS/Orchestration layer. 

        The functionality of the OSS/Orchestration layer and the interface 
        toward the MDSC are usually operator-specific and outside the scope 
        of this draft. Therefore, this document assumes that the 
        OSS/Orchestrator requests the MDSC to set up L2/L3 VPN network 
        services through mechanisms outside this document's scope. 

        There are two prominent workflow cases when the MDSC multi-layer 
        coordination is initiated: 

        o  Initiated by request from the OSS/Orchestration layer to setup 
           L2/L3 VPN network services that require multi-layer/multi-domain 
           coordination; 

        o  The MDSC initiates them to perform multi-layer/multi-domain 
           optimizations and/or maintenance activities (e.g. rerouting LSPs 
           with their associated services when putting a resource, like a 
           fibre, in maintenance mode during a maintenance window). 
           Unlike service fulfilment, these workflows are not related to a 
           network service provisioning request received from 
           the OSS/Orchestration layer. 

        The latter workflow cases are outside the scope of this document. 

        This document analyses the use cases where multi-layer coordination 
        is triggered by a network service request received from the 
        OSS/Orchestration layer.

          2. Inter-domain RSVP-TE 
          3. Inter-domain SR-TE 

        This document analyses the inter-domain TE options for which the TE 
        tunnel model, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], could be used at the MPI for 
        intra-domain or inter-domain TE configuration. The analysis of other 
        options is outside the scope of this draft. 

        It is also assumed that: 

        o  the bandwidth of each intra-domain TE path is managed by its 
           respective P-PNC; 

        o  technology-specific mechanisms (in the case of inter-domain SR-TE, 
           the binding SID) are used for the inter-domain TE path stitching; 

        o  each packet domain in Figure 2 uses technology-specific local 
           protection mechanisms (in the case of SR-TE, TI-LFA), with the 
           awareness of multi-layer TE path properties (e.g., SRLG). 

        In the case of inter-domain TE-paths, it is also assumed that each 
        packet domain in Figure 2 and Figure 3 implements the same TE 
        technology, and the stitching between two domains is done using 
        inter-domain TE. 

        In this scenario, one of the key MDSC functions is to identify the 
        multi-domain/multi-layer TE paths to be used to carry the L2/L3 VPN 
        traffic between PEs belonging to different packet domains and to 
        relay this information to the P-PNCs, to ensure that the PEs’ 
        forwarding tables (e.g., VRF) are properly configured to steer the 
        L2/L3 VPN traffic over the intended multi-domain/multi-layer TE 
        paths. 

        The selection of the TE path should take into account the TE 
        requirements and the binding requirements for the L2/L3 VPN network 
        service. 

        In general, the binding requirements for a network service (e.g., 
        L2/L3 VPN) can be summarized within three cases: 

          1. The customer is asking for VPN isolation to dynamically create 
             and bind tunnels to the service so that they are not shared by 
             other services (e.g. VPN). 
             The level of isolation can be different: 
               a) Hard isolation with deterministic latency means L2/L3 VPN 
                  requires a set of dedicated TE Tunnels (neither sharing

                  tunnels), providing deterministic latency performances 
               b) Hard isolation but without deterministic characteristics 
               c) Soft isolation means the tunnels associated with L2/L3 VPN 
                  are dedicated to that but can compete for bandwidth with 
                  other tunnels. 
          2. The customer does not ask for isolation and could request a VPN 
             service where associated tunnels can be shared across multiple 
             VPNs. 

        For each TE path required to support the L2/L3 VPN network service, 
        it is possible that: 

        1. A TE path that meets the TE and binding requirements already 
           exists in the network. 

        2. An existing TE path could be modified (e.g., through bandwidth 
           increase) to meet the TE and binding requirements: 

            a. The TE path characteristics can be modified only in the packet 
               layer. 

            b. One or more new underlay optical tunnels need to be setup to 
               support the requested changes of the overlay TE paths (multi-
               layer coordination is required). 

        3. A new TE path needs to be setup to meet the TE and binding 
           requirements: 

            a. The new TE path reuses existing underlay optical tunnels; 

            b. One or more new underlay optical tunnels need to be setup to 
               support the setup of the new TE path  (multi-layer 
               coordination is required). 

        This document analyses scenarios where only one TE path is used to 
        carry the VPN traffic between PEs. Scenarios, where multiple parallel 
        TE paths are used in load-balancing to carry the VPN traffic between 
        PEs, are possible but their analysis is outside the scope of this 
        document. 

     2.1.2. Multi-domain and Multi-layer Path Computation 

        When a new TE path needs to be setup, the MDSC is also responsible 
        for coordinating the multi-layer/multi-domain path computation.

        Depending on the knowledge that MDSC has of the topology and 
        configuration of the underlying network domains, three approaches for 
        performing multi-layer/multi-domain path computation are possible: 

        1. Full Summarization: In this approach, the MDSC has an abstracted 
           TE topology view of all of its packet and optical, underlying 
           domains. 
            
           In this case, the MDSC does not have enough TE topology 
           information to perform multi-layer/multi-domain path computation. 
           Therefore the MDSC delegates the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to perform 
           local path computation within their respective controlled domains. 
           Then, it uses the information returned by the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to 
           compute the optimal multi-domain/multi-layer path. 
            
           This approach presents an issue to P-PNC, which does not have the 
           capability of performing a single-domain/multi-layer path 
           computation, since it can not retrieve the topology information 
           from the O-PNCs nor delegate the O-PNC to perform optical path 
           computation. 
            
           A possible solution could include a CNC function within the P-PNC 
           to request the MDSC multi-domain optical path computation, as 
           shown in Figure 10 of [RFC8453]. 
            
           Another solution could be to rely on the MDSC recursive hierarchy, 
           as defined in section 4.1 of [RFC8453], where, for each IP and 
           optical domain pair, a "lower-level MDSC" (MDSC-L) provides the 
           essential multi-layer correlation and the "higher-level MDSC" 
           (MDSC-H) provides the multi-domain coordination. 
           In this case, the MDSC-H can get an abstract view of the 
           underlying multi-layer domain topologies from its underlying MDSC-
           L. Each MDSC-L gets the full view of the IP domain topology from 
           P-PNC and can get an abstracted view of the optical domain 
           topology from its underlying O-PNC. In other words, topology 
           abstraction is possible at the MPIs between MDSC-L and O-PNC and 
           between MDSC-L and MDSC-H.

        2. Partial summarization: In this approach, the MDSC has complete 
           visibility of the TE topology of the packet network domains and an 
           abstracted view of the TE topology of the optical network domains.  
            
           The MDSC then has only the capability of performing multi-
           domain/single-layer path computation for the packet layer (the 
           path can be computed optimally for the two packet domains). 
             
           Therefore, the MDSC still needs to delegate the O-PNCs to perform 
           local path computation within their respective domains. It uses 
           the information received by the O-PNCs and its TE topology view of 
           the multi-domain packet layer to perform multi-layer/multi-domain 
           path computation. 

        3. Full knowledge: In this approach, the MDSC has a complete and 
           enough detailed view of the TE topology of all the network domains 
           (both optical and packet). 
            
           In such case MDSC has all the information needed to perform multi-
           domain/multi-layer path computation, without relying on PNCs. 
            
           This approach may present, as a potential drawback, scalability 
           issues and, as discussed in section 2.2. of [PATH-COMPUTE], 
           performing path computation for optical networks in the MDSC is 
           quite challenging because the optimal paths depend also on 
           vendor-specific optical attributes (which may be different in the 
           two domains if different vendors provide them). 

        This document analyses scenarios where the MDSC uses the partial 
        summarization approach to coordinate multi-domain/multi-layer path 
        computation. 

        Typically, the O-PNCs are responsible for the optical path 
        computation of services across their respective single domains. 
        Therefore, when setting up the network service, they must consider 
        the connection requirements such as bandwidth, amplification, 
        wavelength continuity, and non-linear impairments that may affect the 
        network service path. 

        The methods and types of path requirements and impairments, such as 
        those detailed in [OIA-TOPO], used by the O-PNC for optical path 
        computation are not exposed at the MPI and therefore out of scope for 
        this document.

     2.2. IP/MPLS Domain Controller and NE Functions 

        Each packet domain in Figure 1, corresponding to either an IGP area 
        or an Autonomous System (AS) within the same operator network, is 
        controlled by a packet domain controller (P-PNC). 

        P-PNCs are responsible for setting up the TE paths between any two 
        PEs or BRs in their respective controlled domains, as requested by 
        MDSC,  and providing topology information to the MDSC. 

        For example, for inter-domain SR-TE, the setup bidirectional SR-TE 
        path from PE13 in domain 1 to PE23 in domain 2, as shown in Figure 3, 
        requires the MDSC to coordinate the actions of: 

        o  P-PNC1 to push a SID list to PE13 including the Binding SID 
           associated to the SR-TE path in Domain 2 with PE23 as the target 
           destination (forward direction); 

        o  P-PNC2 to push a SID list to PE23, including the Binding SID 
           associated with the SR-TE path in Domain 1 with PE13 as the target 
           destination (reverse direction). 

        With reference to Figure 4, P-PNCs are then responsible: 

        1. To expose to MDSC their respective detailed TE topology 

        2. To perform single-layer single-domain local TE path computation, 
           when requested by MDSC between two PEs (for single-domain end-to-
           end TE path) or between PEs and BRs for an inter-domain TE path 
           selected by MDSC; 

        3. To configure the routers in their respective domain to setup a TE 
           path; 

        4. To configure the VRF and PE-CE interfaces (Service access points) 
           of the intra-domain and inter-domain network services requested by 
           the MDSC.

        When requesting the setup of a new TE path, the MDSC provides the P-
        PNCs with the explicit path to be created or modified. In other 
        words, the MDSC can communicate to the P-PNCs the complete list of 
        nodes involved in the path (strict mode). In this case, the P-PNC is 
        just responsible to set up that explicit TE path. For example: 

        o  with SR-TE, the P-PNC pushes to headend PE or BR the list of SIDs 
           to create the explicit SR-TE path, provided by the MDSC; 

        o  with RSVP-TE, the P-PNC requests the headend PE or BR to start 
           signaling the explicit RSVP-TE path, provided by the MDSC. 

        To scale in large SR-TE packet domains, the MDSC can provide P-PNC a 
        loose path, together with per-domain TE constraints. The P-PNC can 
        then select the complete path within its domain. 

        In such a case, it is mandatory that P-PNC signals back to the MDSC 
        which path it has chosen so that the MDSC keeps track of the relevant 
        resources utilization. 

        From the Figure 3 example, the TE path requested by the MDSC touches 
        PE13 - P16 – BR12 – BR21 – PE23. P-PNC2 is aware of two paths with 
        the same topology metric, e.g. BR21 – P24 – PE23 and BR21 – BR22 –

        PE23, but with different loads. It may prefer to steer the traffic on 
        the latter because it is less loaded.  

        For the purposes of this document it is assumed that the MDSC always 
        provides the explicit list of all the hops to the P-PNCs to setup or 
        modify the TE path. 

     2.3. Optical Domain Controller and NE Functions 

        The optical network provides underlay connectivity services to 
        IP/MPLS networks. The packet and optical multi-layer coordination is 
        done by the MDSC, as shown in Figure 1.  

        The O-PNC is responsible to: 

        o  provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology view of its underlying 
           optical network resources; 

        o  perform single-domain local path computation, when requested by 
           the MDSC; 

        o  perform optical tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC. 

        The mechanisms used by O-PNC to perform intra-domain topology 
        discovery and path setup are usually vendor-specific and outside the 
        scope of this document. 

        Depending on the type of optical network, TE topology abstraction, 
        path computation and path setup can be single-layer (either OTN or 
        WDM) or multi-layer OTN/WDM. In the latter case, the multi-layer 
        coordination between the OTN and WDM layers is performed by the 
        O-PNC. 

     3. Interface Protocols and YANG Data Models for the MPIs 

        This section describes general assumptions applicable to all the MPI 
        interfaces, between each PNC (Optical or Packet) and the MDSC, to 
        support the scenarios discussed in this document. 

     3.1. RESTCONF Protocol at the MPIs 

        The RESTCONF protocol, as defined in [RFC8040], using the JSON 
        representation defined in [RFC7951], is assumed to be used at these 
        interfaces. In addition, extensions to RESTCONF, as defined in 
        [RFC8527], to be compliant with Network Management Datastore

        Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342], are assumed to be used as 
        well at these MPI interfaces and also at MDSC NBI interfaces. 

     3.2. YANG Data Models at the MPIs 

        The data models used on these interfaces are assumed to use the YANG 
        1.1 Data Modeling Language, as defined in [RFC7950]. 

        This section describes the YANG data models that are applicable to 
        the Packet and Optical MPIs. Some of these YANG data models can be 
        optional dependending on the specific network configuration detailed 
        in section 4 and setion 5. 

     3.2.1. Common YANG Data Models at the MPIs 

        As required in [RFC8040], the "ietf-yang-library" YANG module defined 
        in [RFC8525] is used to allow the MDSC to discover the set of YANG 
        modules supported by each PNC at its MPI. 

        Both Optical and Packet PNCs can use the following common topology 
        YANG data models at the MPI: 

        o  The Base Network Model, defined in the “ietf-network” YANG module 
           of [RFC8345]; 

        o  The Base Network Topology Model, defined in the “ietf-network-
           topology” YANG module of [RFC8345], which augments the Base 
           Network Model; 

        o  The TE Topology Model, defined in the “ietf-te-topology” YANG 
           module of [RFC8795], which augments the Base Network Topology 
           Model. 

        Optical and Packet PNCs can use the common TE Tunnel Model, defined 
        in the “ietf-te” YANG module of [TE-TUNNEL], at the MPI. 

        All the common YANG data models are generic and augmented by 
        technology-specific YANG modules, as described in the following 
        sections. 

        Both Optical and Packet PNCs can also use the Ethernet Topology 
        Model, defined in the “ietf-eth-te-topology” YANG module of 
        [CLIENT-TOPO], which augments the TE Topology Model with Ethernet 
        technology-specific information.

        Both Optical and Packet PNCs can use the following common 
        notifications YANG data models at the MPI: 

        o  Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over RESTCONF 
           as defined in [RFC8650]; 

        o  Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastores updates as 
           defined in [RFC8641]. 

        PNCs and MDSCs comply with subscription requirements as stated in 
        [RFC7923]. 

     3.2.2. YANG models at the Optical MPIs 

        The Optical PNC can use the following technology-specific topology 
        YANG data models, which augment the generic TE Topology Model: 

        o  The WSON Topology Model, defined in the “ietf-wson-topology” YANG 
           module of [RFC9094]; 

        o  the Flexi-grid Topology Model, defined in the “ietf-flexi-grid-
           topology” YANG module of [Flexi-TOPO]; 

        o  the OTN Topology Model, as defined in the “ietf-otn-topology” YANG 
           module of [OTN-TOPO]. 

        The optical PNC can use the following technology-specific tunnel YANG 
        data models, which augments the generic TE Tunnel Model: 

        o  The WDM Tunnel Model, defined in the “ietf-wdm-tunnel” YANG module 
           of [WDM-TUNNEL]; 

        o  the OTN Tunnel Model, defined in the “ietf-otn-tunnel” YANG module 
           of [OTN-TUNNEL]. 

        The optical PNC can use the generic Path Computation YANG RPC, 
        defined in the “ietf-te-path-computation” YANG module of 
        [PATH-COMPUTE]. 

        Note that technology-specific augmentations of the generic path 
        computation RPC for WSON, Flexi-grid and OTN path computation RPCs 
        have been identified as a gap. 

        The optical PNC uses can use the following client signal YANG data 
        models:

        o  the CBR Client Signal Model, defined in the “ietf-trans-client-
           service” YANG module of [CLIENT-SIGNAL]; 

        o  the Ethernet Client Signal Model, defined in the “ietf-eth-tran-
           service” YANG module of [CLIENT-SIGNAL]. 

     3.2.3. YANG data models at the Packet MPIs 

        The Packet PNC can use the following technology-specific topology 
        YANG data models: 

        o  The L3 Topology Model, defined in the “ietf-l3-unicast-topology”

     3.3. Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) 

        [RFC8637] examines the applicability of a Path Computation Element 
        (PCE) [RFC5440] and PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to the ACTN 
        framework. It further describes how the PCE architecture applies to 
        ACTN and lists the PCEP extensions needed to use PCEP as an ACTN 
        interface.  The stateful PCE [RFC8231], PCE-Initiation [RFC8281], 
        stateful Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [RFC8751], and PCE as a central 
        controller (PCECC) [RFC8283] are some of the key extensions that 
        enable the use of PCE/PCEP for ACTN. 

        Since the PCEP supports path computation in the packet and optical 
        networks, PCEP is well suited for inter-layer path computation. 
        [RFC5623] describes a framework for applying the PCE-based 
        architecture to interlayer (G)MPLS traffic engineering. Furthermore, 
        section 6.1 of [RFC8751] states the H-PCE applicability for inter-
        layer or POI. 

        [RFC8637] lists various PCEP extensions that apply to ACTN. It also 
        lists the PCEP extension for the optical network and POI.  

        Note that the PCEP can be used in conjunction with the YANG data 
        models described in the rest of this document. Depending on whether 
        ACTN is deployed in a greenfield or brownfield, two options are 
        possible:  

        1. The MDSC uses a single RESTCONF/YANG interface towards each PNC to 
           discover all the TE information and request TE tunnels. It may 
           perform full multi-layer path computation or delegate path 
           computation to the underneath PNCs. 
            
           This approach is desirable for operators from a multi-vendor 
           integration perspective as it is simple. We need only one type of 
           interface (RESTCONF) and use the relevant YANG data models 
           depending on the operator use case considered. The benefits of 
           having only one protocol for the MPI between MDSC and PNC have 
           already been highlighted in [PATH-COMPUTE].

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        4. The MDSC uses the RESTCONF/YANG interface towards each PNC to 
           discover all the TE information and requests the creation of TE 
           tunnels. However, it uses PCEP for hierarchical path computation. 
            
           As mentioned in Option 1, from an operator perspective, this 
           option can add integration complexity to have two protocols 
           instead of one unless the RESTOCONF/YANG interface is added to an 
           existing PCEP deployment (brownfield scenario). 

        Section 4 and section 5 of this draft analyse the case where a single 
        RESTCONF/YANG interface is deployed at the MPI (i.e., option 1 
        above). 

     4. Inventory, Service and Network Topology Discovery 

        In this scenario, the MSDC needs to discover through the underlying 
        PNCs: 

        o  the network topology, at both optical and IP layers, in terms of 
           nodes and links, including the access links, inter-domain IP links 
           as well as cross-layer links; 

        o  the optical tunnels supporting multi-layer intra-domain IP links; 

        o  both intra-domain and inter-domain L2/L3 VPN network services 
           deployed within the network; 

        o  the TE paths supporting those L2/L3 VPN network services; 

        o  the hardware inventory information of IP and optical equipment. 

        The O-PNC and P-PNC could discover and report the hardware network 
        inventory information of their equipment used by the different 
        management layers. In the context of POI, the inventory information 
        of IP and optical equipment can complement the topology views and 
        facilitate the packet/optical multi-layer view, e.g., by providing a 
        mapping between the lowest level LTPs in the topology view and 
        corresponding physical port in the network inventory view. 

        The MDSC could also discover the entire network inventory information 
        of both IP and optical equipment and correlate this information with 
        the links reported in the network topology. 

        Reporting the entire inventory and detailed topology information of 
        packet and optical networks to the MDSC may present scalability 
        issues as a potential drawback. The analysis of the scalability of

        this approach and mechanisms to address potential issues is outside 
        the scope of this document. 

        Each PNC provides the MDSC the topology view of the domain it 
        controls, as described in section 4.1 and 4.3. The MDSC uses this 
        information to discover the complete topology view of the multi-layer 
        multi-domain networks it controls. 

        The MDSC should also maintain up-to-date inventory, service and 
        network topology databases of IP and optical layers through IETF 
        notifications through MPI with the PNCs when any network 
        inventory/topology/service change occurs. 

        It should also be possible to correlate information from IP and 
        optical layers (e.g., which port, lambda/OTSi, and direction are used 
        by a specific IP service on the WDM equipment). 

        In particular, for the cross-layer links, it is key for MDSC to 
        automatically correlate the information from the PNC network 
        databases about the physical ports from the routers (single link or 
        bundle links for LAG) to client ports in the ROADM. 

       The analysis of multi-layer fault management is outside the scope of 
       this document. However, the discovered information should be 
       sufficient for the MDSC to correlate optical and IP layers alarms to 
       speed-up troubleshooting easily. 

       Alarms and event notifications are required between MDSC and PNCs so 
       that any network changes are reported almost in real-time to the MDSC 
       (e.g., NE or link failure). As specified in [RFC7923], MDSC must 
       subscribe to specific objects from PNC YANG datastores for 
       notifications. 

     4.1. Optical Topology Discovery 

        The WSON Topology Model and the Flexi-grid Topology model can be used 
        to report the DWDM network topology (e.g., ROADM nodes and links), 
        depending on whether the DWDM optical network is based on fixed-grid 
        or flexible-grid or a mix of fixed-grid and flexible-grid. 

        It is worth noting that, as described in Appendix I of [ITU-
        T_G.694.1], a fixed-grid can also be described as a flexible grid 
        with constraints: for example a 50GHz fixed-grid can be described as 
        a flexible-grid which supports only m=4 and values of n which are 
        only multiplier of 8.

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        As a consequence: 

        o  A flexible-grid DWDM network topology can only be reported using 
           the Flexi-grid Topology model; 

        o  A fixed-grid DWDM network topology, can be reported using either 
           the WSON Topology model or the Flexi-grid Topology model; 

        o  A mixed fixed and flexible grid DWDM network topology can be 
           reported using either the Flexi-grid Topology model or both WSON 
           and Flexi-grid topology models. 

        Clarifying how both WSON and Flexi-grid topology models could be used 
        together (e.g., through multi-inheritance as described in 
        [TE-TOPO-PF]) has been identified as a gap. 

        The OTN Topology Model is used to report the OTN network topology 
        (e.g., OTN switching nodes and links), when the OTN switching layer 
        is deployed within the optical domain. 

        To allow the MDSC to discover the complete multi-layer and multi-
        domain network topology and to correlate it with the hardware 
        inventory information, the O-PNCs report an abstract optical network 
        topology where: 

        o  one TE node is reported for each optical NE deployed within the 
           optical network domain; and 

        o  one TE link is reported for each OMS link and, optionally, for 
           each OTN link. 

        Since the MDSC delegates optical path computation to its underlay O-
        PNCs, the following information can be abstracted and not reported at 
        the MPI: 

        o  the optical parameters required for optical path computation, such 
           as those detailed in [OIA-TOPO]; 

        o  the underlay OTS links and ILAs of OMS links; 

        o  the physical connectivity between the optical transponders and the 
           ROADMs.

        The OTN Topology Model also reports the CBR client LTPs that 
        terminates the cross-layer links: once CBR client LTP is reported for 
        each CBR or multi-function client interface on the optical NEs (see 
        sections 4.4 and 5.1 of [TNBI] for the description of multi-function 
        client interfaces). 

        The Ethernet Topology Model reports the Ethernet client LTPs that 
        terminate the cross-layer links: one Ethernet client LTP is reported 
        for each Ethernet or multi-function client interface on the optical 
        NEs. 

        The optical transponders and, optionally, the OTN access cards, are 
        abstracted at MPI by the O-PNC as Trail Termination Points (TTPs), 
        defined in [RFC8795], within the optical network topology. This 
        abstraction is valid independently of the fact that optical 
        transponders are physically integrated within the same WDM node or 
        are physically located on a device external to the WDM node since it 
        both cases the optical transponders and the WDM node are under the 
        control of the same O-PNC. 

        The association between the Ethernet or CBR client LTPs terminating 
        the Ethernet cross-layer links and the optical TTPs is reported using 
        the Inter Layer Lock-id (ILL) identifiers, defined in [RFC8795]. 

        For example, with a reference to Figure 5, the ILL values X and Y are 
        used to associated the client LTPs (7-0) in NE11 and (8-0) in NE12 
        with the corresponding optical TTPs (7) in NE11 and (8) in NE12, 
        respectively.

        When the OTN switching layer is deployed within the optical domain, 
        the OTN Tunnel Model is used to report all the OTN tunnels 
        established within the optical network. 

        The Ethernet client signal model and the Transparent CBR client 
        signal model are used to report all the connectivity services 
        provided by the underlay optical tunnels between Ethernet or CBR 
        client LTPs, depending on whether the connectivity service is frame-
        based or transparent. The underlay optical tunnels can be either WDM 
        tunnels or, when the optional OTN switching layer is deployed, OTN 
        tunnels. 

        The WDM tunnels can be used to support either Ethernet or CBR client 
        signals or multi-layer intra-domain OTN links. In the latter case, 
        the hierarchical-link container, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], associates 
        the underlay WDM tunnel with the supported multi-layer intra-domain 
        OTN link and it allows discovery of the multi-layer path supporting 
        all the connectivity services provided by the optical network. 

        The O-PNCs report in their operational datastores all the Ethernet 
        and CBR client connectivities and all the optical tunnels deployed 
        within their optical domain regarless of the mechanisms being used to 
        set them up, such as the mechanisms described in section 5.2, as well 
        as other mechanism (e.g., static configuration), which are outside 
        the scope of this document. 

     4.3. Packet Topology Discovery 

        The L3 Topology Model is used report the IP network topology. 

        The L3 Topology Model, SR Topology Model, TE Topology Model and the 
        TE Packet Topology Model are used together to report the SR-TE 
        network topology, as described in figure 2 of [SR-TE-TOPO]. 

        The TE Topology Model, TE Packet Topology Model and MPLS-TE Topology 
        Model are used together to report the MPLS-TE network topology, as 
        described in [MPLS-TE-TOPO]. 

        As described in [L3-TE-TOPO], the relationship between the IP network 
        topology and the MPLS-TE network topology depends on whether the two 
        network topologies are congruent or not: in the latter case, the L3 
        TE Topology Model is used, together with the L3 Topology Model to 
        provide the association between the two network topologies.

        inventory information as well as to perform multi-domain TE path 
        computation, the P-PNCs report the full packet network, including all 
        the information that the MDSC requires to perform TE path 
        computation. In particular, one TE node is reported for each router 
        and one TE link is reported for each intra-domain IP link. The packet 
        topology also reports the IP LTPs terminating the inter-domain IP 
        links. 

        The Ethernet Topology Model is used to report the intra-domain 
        Ethernet links supporting the intra-domain IP links as well as the 
        Ethernet LTPs that might terminate cross-layer links, inter-domain 
        Ethernet links or access links, as described in detail in section 4.5 
        and in section 4.6. 

        All the intra-domain Ethernet and IP links are discovered by the 
        P-PNCs, using mechanisms, such as LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB], which are 
        outside the scope of this document, and reported at the MPIs within 
        the Ethernet or the packet network topology. 

     4.4. TE Path Discovery 

        We assume that the discovery of existing TE paths, including their 
        bandwidth, at the MPI is done using the generic TE tunnel YANG data 
        model, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with packet technology-specific (e.g., 
        MPLS-TE or SR-TE) augmentations. 

        Note that technology-specific augmentations of the generic path TE 
        tunnel model for SR-TE path setup and discovery is outlined in 
        section 1 of [TE-TUNNEL] but are currently identified as a gap in 
        section 6. 

        To enable MDSC to discover the full end-to-end TE path configuration, 
        the technology-specific augmentation of the [TE-TUNNEL] should allow 
        the P-PNC to report the TE path within its domain (e.g., the SID list 
        assigned to an SR-TE path). 

        For example, considering the L3VPN in Figure 2, the TE path 1 in one 
        direction (PE13-P16-PE14) and the TE path in the reverse direction 
        (between PE14 and PE13) should be reported by the P-PNC1 to the MDSC 
        as TE primary and primary-reverse paths of the same TE tunnel 
        instance. The bandwidth of these TE paths represents the bandwidth 
        allocated by P-PNC1 to the two TE paths, which can be symmetric or 
        asymmetric in the two directions. 

        The P-PNCs use the TE tunnel model to report, at the MPI, all the TE 
        paths established within their packet domain regardless of the

        mechanism being used to set them up; i.e., independently on whether 
        the mechanisms described in section 5.3 or other means, such as 
        static configuration, which are outside the scope of this document, 
        are used. 

     4.5. Inter-domain Link Discovery 

        In the reference network of Figure 1, there are three types of 
        inter-domain links: 

        o  Inter-domain Ethernet links suppoting inter-domain IP links 
           between two adjancent IP domains; 

        o  Cross-layer links between an an IP domain and an adjacent optical 
           domain; 

        o  Access links between a CE device and a PE router. 

        All the three types of links are Ethernet links. 

        It is worth noting that the P-PNC may not be aware whether an 
        Ethernet interface terminates a cross-layer link, an inter-domain 
        Ethernet link or an access link. The TE Topology Model supports the 
        discovery for all these types of links with no need for the P-PNC to 
        know the type of inter-domain link. 

        There are two possible models to report the access links between CEs 
        and PEs: the TE Topology Model, defined in [RFC8795], or the Service 
        Attachment Points (SAP) Model, defined in  [RFC9408]. 

        Although the discovery of access links is outside the scope of this 
        document, clarifying the relationship between these two models has 
        been identified as a gap. 

        The inter-domain Ethernet links and cross-layer links are discovered 
        by the MDSC using the plug-id attribute, as described in section 4.3 
        of [RFC8795]. 

        More detailed description of how the plug-id can be used to discover 
        inter-domain links is also provided in section 5.1.4 of [TNBI]. 

        The plug-id attribute can also be used to discover the access-links, 
        but the analysis of the access-link discovery is outside the scope of 
        this document.

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        This document considers the following two options for discovering 
        inter-domain links: 

        1. Static configuration 

        2. LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] automatic discovery 

        Other options are possible but not described in this document. 

        As outlined in [TNBI], the encoding of the plug-id namespace and the 
        specific LLDP information reported within the plug-id value, such as 
        the Chassis ID and Port ID mandatory TLVs, is implementation specific 
        and needs to be consistent across all the PNCs within the network. 

        The static configuration requires an administrative burden to 
        configure network-wide unique identifiers: it is therefore more 
        viable for inter-domain Ethenet links. For the cross-layer links, the 
        automatic discovery solution based on LLDP snooping is preferable 
        when possible. 

        The routers exchange standard LLDP packets as defined in [IEEE 
        802.1AB] and the optical NEs snoop the LLDP packets received from the 
        local Ethernet interface and report to the O-PNCs the extracted 
        information, such as the Chassis ID, the Port ID, System Name TLVs. 

        Note that the optical NEs do not actively participate in the LLDP 
        packet exchange and does not send any LLDP packets. 

     4.5.1. Cross-layer Link Discovery 

        The MDSC can discover a cross-layer link by matching the plug-id 
        values of the two LTPs reported by two adjacent O-PNC and P-PNC: in 
        case LLDP snooping is used, the P-PNC reports the LLDP information 
        sent by the corresponding Ethernet interface on the router while the 
        O-PNC reports the LLDP information received by the corresponding 
        Ethernet interface on the optical NE, e.g., between LTP 5-0 on PE13 
        and LTP 7-0 on NE11, as shown in Figure 6.

        As described in section 4.1, the LTP terminating a cross-layer link 
        is reported by an O-PNC in the Ethernet topology or in the OTN 
        topology model or in both models, depending on the type of 
        corresponding physical port on the optical NE. 

        It is worth noting that the discovery of cross-layer links is based 
        only on the LLDP information sent by the Ethernet interfaces of the 
        routers and received by the Ethernet interfaces of the optical NEs. 
        Therefore the MDSC can discover these links also before optical 
        paths, supporting overlay multi-layer IP links, are setup.

        If the P-PNC does not know a priori whether an Ethernet interface on 
        a router terminates a cross-layer link or an inter-domain Ethernet 
        link, it has to report at the MPI two Ethernet LTPs representing the 
        same Ethernet interface, e.g., both the Ethernet LTP 3-0 and the 
        Ethenet LTP 3-1, supported by LTP 3-0, shown in Figure 7: 

        o  The physical Ethernet LTP (e.g., LTP 3-0 in BR11, as shown in 
           Figure 7) is used to represent the physical adjacency between the 
           router Ethernet interface and either the adjacent router Ethernet 
           interface (in case of a single-layer Ethernet link) or the optical 
           NE Ethernet interface (in case of a multi-layer Ethernet link). 
           Therefore, as described in section 4.5.1, the P-PNC reports, 
           within the plug-id attribute of this LTP, the LLDP information 
           sent by the corresponding router Ethernet interface; such as the 
           {BR11,3} and {BR21,4} plug-id values reported, respectively, by 
           the Ethernet LTP 3-0 on BR11 and by the Ethernet LTP 4-0 on BR21, 
           as shown in Figure 7; 

        o  The logical Ethernet LTP (e.g., LTP 3-1 in BR11, as shown in 
           Figure 7), supported by a physical Ethernet LTP (e.g., LTP 3-0 in 
           BR11, as shown in Figure 7), is used to discover the logical 
           adjacency between router Ethernet interfaces, which can be either 
           single-layer or multi-layer. Therefore, the P-PNC reports, within 
           the plug-id attribute of this LTP, the LLDP information sent and 
           received by the corresponding router Ethernet interface; such as 
           the {BR11,3,BR21,4} plug-id values reported by the Ethernet LTP 3-
           1 on BR11 and by the Ethernet LTP 4-1 on BR21, as shown in Figure 
           7. 

        It is worth noting that in case of an inter-domain single-layer 
        Ethernet links, the MDSC cannot discover, using the the LLDP 
        information reported in the plug-id attributes, the physical 
        adjacency between the two router Ethernet interfaces because these 
        two plug-id values do not match, such as the plug-id values {BR11,3} 
        and {BR21,4} shown in Figure 7. However, the MDSC may infer the 
        physical intra-domain Etherent links if it knows a priori, using 
        mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document, that the 
        Ethernet interfaces on the routers either terminates a cross-layer 
        link or a single-layer (intra-domain or inter-domain) Ethernet link, 
        e.g., as shown in Figure 7. 

        The P-PNC can omit reporting the physical Ethernet LTPs when it 
        knows, by mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document, 
        that the corresponding router Ethernet interfaces terminate single-
        layer inter-domain Ethernet links.

        The MDSC can then discover an inter-domain IP link between the two IP 
        LTPs that are supported by the two Ethernet LTPs terminating an 
        inter-domain Ethernet link, discovered as described in section 4.5.2, 
        e.g., between the IP LTP 3-2 on BR21 and the IP LTP 4-2 on BR22, 
        supported respectively by the Ethernet LTP 3-1 on BR11 and by the 
        Ethernet LTP 4-1 on BR21, as shown in Figure 7.

        A multi-layer intra-domain IP link and its supporting multi-layer 
        intra-domain Ethernet link are discovered by the P-PNC like any other 
        intra-domain IP and Ethernet links, as described in section 4.3, and

         Figure 8 – Multi-layer intra-domain Ethernet and IP link discovery 

        The P-PNC does not report any plug-id information on the logical 
        Ethernet LTPs terminating intra-domain Ethernet links, such as the 
        LTP 5-1 on PE13 and LTP 6-1 in BR11 shown in Figure 8, since these 
        links are discovered by the PNC. 

        In addition, the P-PNC also reports the physical Ethernet LTPs that 
        terminate the cross-layer links supporting the multi-layer intra-
        domain Ethernet links, e.g., the Ethernet LTP 5-0 on PE13 and the 
        Ethernet LTP 6-0 on BR11, shown in Figure 8. 

        The MDSC discovers, using the mechanisms described in section 4.5, 
        which Ethernet cross-layer links support the multi-layer intra-domain 
        Ethernet links, e.g., the link between LTP 5-0 on PE13 and LTP 7-0 on 
        NE11, shown in Figure 8. 

        The MDSC also discovers, from the information provided by the O-PNC 
        and described in section 4.2, which optical tunnels support the 
        multi-layer intra-domain IP links and therefore the path within the 
        optical network that supports a multi-layer intra-domain IP link, 
        e.g., as shown in Figure 8. 

     4.6.1. Single-layer Intra-domain IP Links 

        It is worth noting that the P-PNC may not be aware of whether an 
        Ethernet interface on the router terminates a multi-layer or a 
        single-layer intra-domain Ethernet link.

        In this case, the P-PNC, always reports two Ethernet LTPs for each 
        Ethernet interface on the router, e.g., the Ethernet LTP 1-0 and 1-1 
        on PE13, shown in Figure 9.

        It is worth noting that in case of an intra-domain single-layer 
        Ethernet links, the MDSC cannot discover, using the LLDP information 
        reported in the plug-id attributes, the physical adjacency between 
        the two router Ethernet interfaces because the two plug-id values do 
        not match, such as the plug-id values {PE13,1} and {P16,2} shown in 
        Figure 9. However, the MDSC may infer the physical intra-domain 
        Ethernet links, e.g., between LTP 1-0 on PE13 and LTP 2-0 on P16, as 
        shown in Figure 9, if it knows a priori, using mechanisms which are 
        outside the scope of this document, that all the Ethernet interfaces 
        on the routers either terminates a cross-layer link or a single-layer 
        (intra-domain or inter-domain) Ethernet link, e.g., as shown in 
        Figure 9. 

        The P-PNC can omit reporting the physical Ethernet LTP if it knows, 
        by mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document, that the 
        intra-domain Ethernet link is single-layer. 

     4.7. LAG Discovery 

        The P-PNCs can discover the configuration of the LAG groups within 
        its domain and report each intra-domain LAG as an Ethernet bundle 
        link, within the Ethernet topology exposed at the MPI. 

        This is done bundling multiple single-domain Ethernet links, as shown 
        in Figure 10. For example, the Ethernet bundled link between the 
        Ethernet LTP 5-1 on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 6-1 on P24, is built  
        from the Ethernet links setup respectively: 

        o  between the Ethernet LTP 1-1 on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 2-1 on 
           P24; and 

        o  between the Ethernet LTP 3-1 on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 4-1 on 
           P24.

                                  Figure 10   – LAG 

        The mechanisms used by the MDSC to discover single-layer and multi-
        layer intra-domain LAG link is the same (the only difference being 
        whether the bundled links are single-layer or multi-layer). 

        Instead, the mechanisms used by the MDSC to discover single-layer 
        inter-domain LAG links between two BRs are different and outside the 
        scope of this document since they do not imply any cross-layer 
        coordination between packet and optical domains. 

        As described in section 4.3, the mechanisms used by the P-PNC to 
        discover the configuration of the LAG groups within its domain, such 
        as LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB], are outside the scope of this document.

        However, it is worth noting that according to [IEEE 802.1AB], LLDP 
        can be configured on a LAG group (Aggregated Port) and/or on any 
        number of its LAG members (Aggregation Ports). 

        If LLDP is enabled on both LAG members and groups, two types of LLDP 
        packets are transmitted by the routers and received by the optical 
        NEs on some cross-layer links: one sent for the LLDP session 
        configured at LAG member (Aggregation Port)level and another one for 
        the LLDP session configured at LAG group (Aggregated Port)level. This 
        could cause some issues when LLDP snooping is used to discover the 
        cross-layer links, as defined in section 4.5.1. 

        The cross-layer link discovery is based only on the LLDP session 
        configured on the LAG members (Aggregation Ports) to allow discovery 
        of these links independently from the configuration of the underlay 
        optical tunnel or from the LAG group. 

        To avoid any ambiguity on how the optical NEs can identify which LLDP 
        packets belong to which LLDP session, the P-PNC can disable the LLDP 
        sessions on the LAG groups configured by the MDSC (e.g., the multi-
        layer single-domain LAG groups configured using the mechanisms 
        described in section 5.2.1), keeping the LLDP sessions on the LAG 
        members enabled. 

        Another option is to rely on other mechanisms (e.g., the Port type 
        field in the Link Aggregation TLV defined in Annex F of [IEEE 
        802.1AX]) that allow the optical NE to identify which LLDP packets 
        belong to which LLDP session: the O-PNC can then use only the LLDP 
        information from the LLDP sessions configured on the LAG members to 
        support the cross-layer link discovery mechanisms defined in section 
        4.5.1. 

     4.8. L2/L3 VPN Network Services Discovery 

        The P-PNC reports the L2/L3 VPN services configured within its 
        domain, using the L2NM and L3NM network service models, and which 
        packet TE tunnels (e.g., MPLS-TE or SR-TE) are used by each L2/L3 VPN 
        service, using the L2NM and L3NM TE service mapping models. 

        The MDSC can use the information mentioned above together with the 
        packet TE path, packet topology, multi-layer IP links, optical 
        topology and optical path information discovered as described in the 
        previous sections, to discover the multi-layer path used to carry the 
        traffic for each L2/L3 VPN service.

     4.9. Inventory Discovery 

        The are no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to report at 
        the MPI the whole inventory information discovered by a PNC. 

        [RFC8345] had foreseen some work for inventory as an augmentation of 
        the network model, but no YANG data model has been developed so far. 

        There are also no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to 
        correlate topology information, e.g., a link termination point (LTP), 
        with inventory information, e.g., the physical port supporting an 
        LTP, if any. 

        Inventory information through MPI and correlation with topology 
        information is identified as a gap requiring further work and outside 
        of the scope of this draft. 

     5. Establishment of L2/L3 VPN Services with TE Requirements 

        In this scenario the MDSC needs to setup a multi-domain L2VPN or a 
        multi-domain L3VPN with some SLA requirements. 

        The MDSC receives the request to setup a L2/L3 VPN network service 
        from the OSS/Orchestration layer (see Appendix A). 

        The MDSC translates the L2/L3 VPN SLA requirements into TE 
        requirements (e.g., bandwidth, TE metric bounds, SRLG disjointness, 
        nodes/links/domains inclusion/exclusion) and find the TE paths that 
        meet these TE requirements (see section 2.1.1). 

        For example, considering the L3VPN in Figure 2 and Figure 3, the MDSC 
        finds that: 

        o  PE13-P16-PE14 TE path already exists but have not enough bandwidth 
           to support the new L3VPN, as described in section 4.4;, and that: 

            o the IP link(s) between PE13 and P16 has not enough bandwidth 
               to support increasing the bandwidth of that TE path, as 
               described in section 4.3;

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

            o a new underlay optical tunnel could be setup to increase the 
               bandwidth of the IP link(s) between PE13 and P16 to support 
               increasing the bandwidth of that overlay TE path, as described 
               in section 5.1. The dimensioning of the underlay optical 
               tunnel is decided by the MDSC based on the TE requirements 
               (e.g., the bandwidth) requested by the TE path and on its 
               multi-layer optimization policy, which is an internal MDSC 
               implementation issue; 

            o a new multi-domain TE path needs to be setup between PE13 and 
               PE23, e.g., either because existing TE paths between PE13 and 
               PE23 are not able to meet the TE and binding requirements of 
               the L2/L3 VPN service or because there is no TE path between 
               PE13 and PE23. 

        As described in section 2.1.2, with partial summarization, the MDSC 
        will use the TE topology information provided by the P-PNCs and the 
        results of the path computation requests sent to the O-PNCs, as 
        described in section 5.1, to compute the multi-layer/multi-domain 
        path between PE13 and PE23. 

        For example, the multi-layer/multi-domain performed by the MDSC could 
        require the setup of: 

        o  a new underlay optical tunnel between PE13 and BR11, supporting a 
           new IP link, as described in section 5.2; 

        o  a new underlay optical tunnel between BR21 and P24 to increase the 
           bandwidth of the IP link(s) between BR21 and P24, as described in 
           section 5.2. 

        When the setup of the L2/L3 VPN network service requires multi-domain 
        and multi-layer coordination, the MDSC is also responsible for 
        coordinating the network configuration required to realize the 
        request network service across the appropriate optical and packet 
        domains. 

        The MDSC would therefore request: 

        o  the O-PNC1 to setup a new optical tunnel between the ROADMs 
           connected to PE13 and P16, as described in section 5.2; 

        o  the P-PNC1 to update the configuration of the existing IP link, in 
           case of LAG, or configure a new IP link, in case of ECMP, between 
           PE13 and P16, as described in section 5.2;

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        o  the P-PNC1 to update the bandwidth of the selected TE path between 
           PE13 and PE14, as described in section 5.3. 

        After that, the MDSC requests P-PNC2 to setup a TE path between BR21 
        and PE23, with an explicit path (BR21, P24, PE23) to constrainthis 
        new TE path to use the new underlay optical tunnel setup between BR21 
        and P24, as described in section 5.3. The P-PNC2 properly configures 
        the routers within its domain to setup the requested path and returns 
        to the MDSC the information which is needed for multi-domain TE path 
        stitching. For example, in case of inter-domain SR-TE, the P-PNC2, 
        knowing the node and the adjacency SIDs assigned within its domain, 
        can install the proper SR policy, or hierarchical policies, within 
        BR21 and returns to the MDSC the binding SID it has assigned to this 
        policy in BR21. 

        Then the MDSC requests P-PNC1 to setup a TE path between PE13 and 
        BR11, with an explicit path (PE13, BR11) to constrain this new TE 
        path to use the new underlay optical tunnel setup between PE13 and 
        BR11, specifying also which inter-domain link should be used to send 
        traffic to BR21 and the information to be used for the multi-domain 
        TE path stitching, as described in section 4.4 (e.g., in case of 
        inter-domain SR-TE, the binding SID  that has been assigned by P-PNC2 
        to the corresponding SR policy in BR21). The P-PNC1 properly 
        configures the routers within its domain to setup the requested path 
        and the multi-domain TE path stitching. For example, in case of 
        inter-domain SR-TE, the P-PNC1, knowing also the node and the 
        adjacency SIDs assigned within its domain and the EPE SID assigned by 
        P-PNC1 to the inter-domain link between BR11 and BR21, and the 
        binding SID assigned by P-PNC2, installs the proper policy, or 
        policies, within PE13. 

        Once the TE paths have been selected and, if needed, setup/modified, 
        the MDSC can request to both P-PNCs to configure the L3VPN and its 
        binding with the selected TE paths, as described in section 5.4. 

     5.1. Optical Path Computation 

        As described in section 2.1.2, the optical path computation is 
        usually performed by the O-PNCs. 

        When performing multi-layer/multi-domain path computation, the MDSC 
        can delegate the O-PNC for single-domain optical path computation. 

        As described in sections 4.1, 4.5 and 4.6, there is a one-to-one 
        relationship between a multi-layer intra-domain IP link and its 
        underlay optical tunnel. Therefore, the properties of an optical path

        between two optical TTPs, as computed by the O-PNC, can be used by 
        the MDSC to infer the properties of the associated multi-layer 
        single-domain IP link. 

        As discussed in [PATH-COMPUTE], there are two options to request an 
        O-PNC to perform optical path computation: either via a "compute-
        only" TE tunnel path, using the generic TE tunnel YANG data model 
        defined in [TE-TUNNEL] or via the path computation RPC defined in 
        [PATH-COMPUTE]. 

        This draft assumes that the path computation RPC is used. 

        There are no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to augment 
        the generic path computation RPC with technology-specific attributes. 

        Optical technology-specific augmentation for the path computation RPC 
        is identified as a gap requiring further work outside of this draft's 
        scope. 

     5.2. Multi-layer IP Link Setup 

        As described in section 5.1, there is a one-to-one relationship 
        between a multi-layer intra-domain IP link and its underlay optical 
        tunnel. 

        Therefore, to setup a new multi-layer intra-domain IP link, the MDSC 
        requires the O-PNC to setup the  optical tunnel (using either the WDM 
        Tunnel model or the OTN Tunnel model, if the optional OTN switching 
        is supported) within the optical network and to steer the client 
        traffic between the two cross-layer links over that optical tunnel, 
        using either the Ethernet Client Signal Model (for frame-based 
        transport) or the Transparent CBR Client Signal Model (for 
        transparent transport). 

        For example, with a reference to Figure 11, the MDSC can request the 
        O-PNC1 to setup an optical tunnel between the optical TTPs (7) on 
        NE11 and (8) on NE12 and to steer over this tunnel the client traffic 
        between LTP (7-0) on NE11 and LTP (8-0) on NE12. 

        Editors Note: Add a new Figure 11 which is an exact copy of Figure 8 
         
                       Figure 11   – Multi-layer IP link setup 

        After the optical tunnel has been setup and the client traffic 
        steering configured, the two IP routers can exchange Ethernet frames 
        between themselves, including LLDP messages.

        If LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] or any other discovery mechanisms, which are 
        outside the scope of this document, is used between the adjacency 
        between the two routers’ ports, the P-PNC can automatically discover 
        the underlay multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link being set up by 
        the MDSC and report it to the P-PNC, as described in section 4.6. 

        Otherwise, if there are no automatic discovery mechanisms, the MDSC 
        can configure this multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link at the MPI 
        of the P-PNC. 

        The two Ethernet LTPs terminating this multi-layer single-domain 
        Ethernet link are supported by the two underlay Ethernet LTPs 
        terminating the two cross-layer links, e.g., the LTP 5-1 on PE13 and 
        6-1 on BR11 shown in Figure 11. 

        After the multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link has been configured 
        by the MDSC or discovered by the P-PNC, the corresponding multi-layer 
        single-domain IP link can also be configured either by the MDSC or by 
        the P-PNC. 

        This document assumes that this IP link is configured by the P-PNC. 

        It is worth noting that if LAG is not supported within the domain 
        controlled by the P-PNC, the P-PNC can configure the multi-layer 
        single-domain IP link as soon as the underlay multi-layer single-
        domain Ethernet link is either discovered by the P-PNC or configured 
        by the MDSC at the MPI. However, if LAG is supported the P-PNC has 
        not enough information to know whether the discovered/configured 
        multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link would be: 

        1. Used to support a multi-layer single-domain IP link; 

        2. Used to create a new LAG group; 

        3. Added to an existing LAG group. 

        Therefore the P-PNC does not take any further action after a multi-
        layer single-domain Ethernet link is discovered or configured by the 
        MDSC at the MPI. 

        The MDSC can request the P-PNC to configure a new multi-layer single-
        domain IP link, supported by the the just discovered or configured 
        multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link, by creating an IP link 
        within the running datastore of the P-PNC MPI. Only the IP link, IP 
        LTPs and the reference to the supporting multi-layer single-domain

        Ethernt link are configured by the MDSC. All the other configuration 
        is provided by the P-PNC. 

        For example, with a reference to Figure 11, the MDSC can request the 
        P-PNC1 to setup a multi-layer single-domain IP Link between IP LTP 5-
        2 on PE13 and IP LTP 6-2 on BR11 supported by the multi-layer single-
        domain Ethernet link between ETH LTP 5-1 on PE13 and ETH LTP 6-1 on 
        BR11. 

        The P-PNC configures the requested multi-layer single-domain IP link 
        and, once finished, reports it to the MDSC within the IP topology 
        exposed at its MPI. 

     5.2.1. Multi-layer LAG Setup 

        The P-PNC configures a new LAG group between two routers when the 
        MDSC creates at the MPI a new Ethernet bundled link (using the 
        bundled-link container defined in [RFC8795]) bundling the multi-layer 
        single-domain Ethernet link(s) being created, as described above. 

        When a new LAG link is created, it is also recommended to configure 
        the minimum number of active member links required to consider the 
        LAG link as being up. For example, a LAG link with three members can 
        be considered up when only one member link fails and down when at 
        least two member links fail. 

        The attribute required to configure the minimum number of active 
        member links is missing in [CLIENT-TOPO] and this is identified as a 
        gap in section 6. 

        It is worth noting that a new LAG group can be created to bundle one 
        or more multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link(s). 

        For example, with a reference to Figure 10, the MDSC can request the 
        P-PNC2 to setup an Ethernet bundled link between the Ethernet LTP 5-1 
        on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 6-1 on P24, bundling the multi-layer 
        single-domain Ethernet link between the Etherent LTP 1-1 on BR21 and 
        the Ethernet LTP 2-1 on P24. 

        It is worth noting that the MDSC needs to create also the Ethernet 
        LTPs terminating the Ethernet bundled link. 

        The MDSC can request the P-PNC to configure a new multi-layer single-
        domain IP link, supported by the the just configured Ethernet bundled 
        link, following the same procedure described in section 5.2 above.

        For example, with a reference to Figure 10, the MDSC can request the 
        P-PNC2 to setup a multi-layer single-domain IP Link between IP LTP 5-
        2 on BR21 and IP LTP 6-2 on P24 supported by the Ethernet bundle link 
        between ETH LTP 5-1 on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 6-1 on P24. 

     5.2.2. Multi-layer LAG Update 

        The P-PNC adds new member(s) to an existing LAG group when the MDSC 
        updates at the MPI the configuration of an existing Ethernet bundled 
        link adding the multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link(s) being 
        created, as described above. 

        When member links are added or removed from a LAG link, the minimum 
        number of active member links required to consider the LAG link as 
        being up may also need to be updated. 

        For example, with a reference to Figure 10, the MDSC can request the 
        P-PNC2 to add the multi-layer single-domain Ethernet link setup 
        between the Etherent LTP 3-1 on BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 4-1 on P24 
        to the existing Ethernet bundle link setup between the Ethernet LTP 
        5-1 on node BR21 and the Ethernet LTP 6-1 on node P24. 

        After the LAG configuration has been updated, the P-PNC can also 
        update the bandwidth information of the multi-layer single-domain IP 
        link supported by the updated Ethernet bundled link. 

     5.2.3. Multi-layer TE path properties Configuration 

        The MDSC can discover the TE path properties (e.g., the list of 
        SRLGs, the delay) of a multi-layer IP link from the TE properties of: 

        o  the IP LTPs terminating the multi-layer IP link (e.g., the list of 
           SRLGs reported by the P-PNC using the packet TE topology model);  

        o  the optical path (e.g., the list of SRLGs reported by the O-PNC 
           using the WDM or OTN tunnel model); and  

        o  the cross-domain links (e.g., the list of SRLGs reported by the O-
           PNC and P-PNC respectively, using the WSON and/or flexi-grid, the 
           OTN and the packet TE topology models). 

        The MDSC can also report this information to the P-PNC by properly 
        configuring the multi-layer IP link properties using the packet TE 
        topology model at the packet PNC MPI.

     Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                   February 2024 
         

        This information is used by the P-PNC at least when computing the 
        local protection path, as described in section 5.3, e.g., to ensure 
        that the local protection path is SRLG disjoint with the primary 
        path. 

        It is worth noting that the list of SRLGs for a multi-layer IP link 
        can be quite long. Implementation-specific mechanisms can be 
        implemented by the MDSC or by the O-PNC to summarize the SRLGs of an 
        optical tunnel. These mechanisms are implementation-specific and have 
        no impact on the YANG models nor on the interoperability at the MPI, 
        but cares have to be taken to avoid missing information. 

     5.3. TE Path Setup and Update 

        This version of the draft assumes that TE path setup and update at 
        the MPI could be done using the generic TE tunnel YANG data model, 
        defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with packet technology-specific 
        agumentations, described in section 3.2.3. 

        When a new TE path needs to be setup, the MDSC can use the [TE-
        TUNNEL] model to request the P-PNC to set it up, properly specifying 
        the path constraints, such as the explicit path, to force the P-PNC 
        to setup an TE path that meets the end-to-end TE and binding 
        constraints and uses the optical tunnels setup by the MDSC for the 
        purpose of supporting this new TE path. 

        The [TE-TUNNEL] model supports requesting the setup of both end-
        to-end as well as segment TE tunnels (within one domain). 

        In the latter case, the technology-specific augmentations should 
        allow the configuration of the information needed for multi-domain TE 
        path stiching. 

        For example, the SR-TE specific augmentations of the [TE-TUNNEL] 
        model should be defined to allow the MDSC to configure the binding 
        SIDs to be used for the multi-domain SR-TE path stitching and to 
        allow the P-PNC to report the binding SID assigned to the segment TE 
        paths. Note that the assigned binding SID should be persistent in 
        case router or P-PNC rebooting. 

        The MDSC can also use the [TE-TUNNEL] model to request the P-PNC to 
        increase the bandwidth allocated to an existing TE path, and, if 
        needed, also on its reverse TE path. The [TE-TUNNEL] model supports 
        both symmetric and asymmetric bandwidth configuration in the two 
        directions.

        [Editor’s Note:] Add some text about the protection options (to 
        further discuss whether to put this text here or in section 4.2.2). 

        The MDSC also request the P-PNC to configure local protection 
        mechanisms. For example, in case of SR-TE domain, the TI-LFA local 
        protection, as defined in [TI-LFA]: the mechanisms to request the 
        configuration TI-LFA local protection for SR-TE paths using the 
        [TE-TUNNEL] are a gap in the current YANG models. 

        The requested local protection mechanisms within the P-PNC domain are 
        configured by the P-PNC through implementation specific mechanisms 
        which are outside the scope of this document. 

        The P-PNC takes into account the multi-layer TE path properties 
        (e.g., SRLG information), configured by the MDSC as described in 
        section 5.2.3, when computing the protection configuration (e.g., in 
        case of SR-TE domains, the TI-LFA post-convergence path for multi-
        layer single-domain IP links). 

        SR-TE path setup and update (e.g., bandwidth increase) through MPI is 
        identified as a gap requiring further work, which is outside of the 
        scope of this draft. 

     5.4. L2/L3 VPN Network Service Setup 

        The MDSC can use the L2NM and L3NM network service models to request 
        the P-PNCs to setup L2/L3 VPN services and the L2NM and L3NM TE 
        service mapping models to request the P-PNCs to configure the PE 
        routers to steer the L2/L3 VPN traffic to the selected TE tunnels 
        (e.g., MPLS-TE or SR-TE). 

        It is worth noting that the L2NM and L3NM TE service mapping models, 
        defined in [TSM], provide a list of TE tunnel(s) that should be used 
        to forward L2/L3 VPN traffic between the two PEs terminating the 
        listed TE tunnel(s). If the list contains more than one TE tunnel for 
        the same pair of PEs, these TE tunnels are used for load balancing 
        the associated L2/L3 VPN traffic between the same set of two PEs. 

        The possibility to request splitting the traffic, between multiple TE 
        tunnels for the same PEs pair, in a different way than load balancing 
        is identified as a gap requiring further work and outside of the 
        scope of this draft.

     6. Conclusions 

        The analysis provided in this document has shown that the IETF YANG 
        models described in 3.2 provides useful support for Packet Optical 
        Integration (POI) scenarios for resource discovery (network topology, 
        service, tunnels and network inventory discovery) as well as for 
        supporting multi-layer/multi-domain L2/L3 VPN network services. 

        Few gaps have been identified to be addressed by the relevant IETF 
        Working Groups: 

        o  how both WSON and Flexi-grid topology models could be used 
           together (through multi-inheritance): this gap has been identified 
           in section 4.1;. 

        o  network inventory model: this gap has been identified in section 
           4.9 and the solution in [NETWORK-INVENTORY] has been proposed to 
           resolve it; 

        o  technology-specific augmentations of the path computation RPC, 
           defined in [PATH-COMPUTE] for optical networks: this gap has been 
           identified in section 5.1 and the solution in [OPTICAL-PATH-
           COMPUTE] has been proposed to resolve it; 

        o  relationship between a common discovery mechanisms applicable to 
           access links, inter-domain IP links and cross-layer links and the 
           UNI topology discover mechanism defined in [RFC9408]: this gap has 
           been identified in section 4.3; 

        o  a mechanism applicable to the P-PNC NBI to configure the SR-TE 
           paths. Technology-specific augmentations of TE Tunnel model, 
           defined in [TE-TUNNEL], are foreseen in section 1 of [TE-TUNNEL] 
           but not yet defined: this gap has been identified in section 5.3; 

        o  an attribute, which is used to configure the minimum number of 
           active member links required to consider the LAG link as being up, 
           is missing from the topology model defined in [CLIENT-TOPO]: this 
           gap has been identified in section 5.2.1; 

        o  a mechanism to configure splitting the L2/L3 VPN traffic, between 
           multiple TE tunnels for the same PEs pair, in a different way than 
           load balancing: this gap has been identified in section 5.4; 

        o  a mechanism to report client connectivity constraints imposed by 
           some muxponder design: this gap has been identified in appendix 
           A.3.

        Although not applicable to this document, it has been noted that 
        being able to use WSON and Flexi-grid topology models together 
        (through multi-inheritance) is not only useful in cases of mixed 
        fixed-grid and flexible-grid DWDM network topology but also the only 
        viable option in case of a mixed CWDM and DWDM network topology. 

        Although not applicable to this document, it has been noted that the 
        WDM tunnel model would support also optical tunnel setup in case of a 
        mixed CWDM and DWDM network topology. 

        Although not analysed in this document, it has been noted that the TE 
        Tunnel model, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], needs also to be enhanced to 
        support scenarios where multiple parallel TE paths are used in load-
        balancing to carry the traffic between two end-points (e.g., VPN 
        traffic between two PEs). 

     7. Security Considerations 

        This document highlights how the ACTN architecture can deploy packet 
        over optical infrastructure services. It highlights how existing IETF 
        protocols and data models may be used for multi-layer services. It 
        reuses several existing IETF protocols and data models for the MPI 
        interfaces between each PNC (Optical or Packet) and the MDSC, 
        including: 

        o  RESTCONF 

        o  NETCONF 

        o  PCEP 

        o  YANG 

        Several existing authentication and encryption practices and 
        techniques may be used to help secure these MPI interfaces. These 
        mechanisms include using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to provide 
        secure transport for RESTCONF, NETCONF and PCEP. Furthermore, access 
        control techniques can also provide additional security. NETCONF 
        supports an Access Control Model (NACM), and RESCONF supports Role 
        Based Access Control (RBAC), which should also ensure that MDSC to 
        PNC communication is based on authorised use and granular control of 
        connectivity and resource requests.

     8. Operational Considerations 

        Telemetry data, such as collecting lower-layer networking health and 
        consideration of network and service performance from POI domain 
        controllers, may be required. These requirements and capabilities 
        will be discussed in future versions of this document. 

     9. IANA Considerations 

        This document requires no IANA actions.

     Appendix A. Additional Scenarios 

     A.1.  OSS/Orchestration Layer 

        The OSS/Orchestration layer is a vital part of the architecture 
        framework for a service provider: 

        o  to abstract (through MDSC and PNCs) the underlying transport 
           network complexity to the Business Systems Support layer; 

        o  to coordinate NFV, Transport (e.g. IP, optical and microwave 
           networks), Fixed Acess, Core and Radio domains enabling full 
           automation of end-to-end services to the end customers; 

        o  to enable catalogue-driven service provisioning from external 
           applications (e.g. Customer Portal for Enterprise Business 
           services), orchestrating the design and lifecycle management of 
           these end-to-end transport connectivity services, consuming IP 
           and/or optical transport connectivity services upon request. 

        As discussed in section 2.1, in this document, the MDSC interfaces 
        with the OSS/Orchestration layer and, therefore, it performs the 
        functions of the Network Orchestrator, defined in [RFC8309]. 

        The OSS/Orchestration layer requests the creation of a network 
        service to the MDSC specifying its end-points (PEs and the interfaces 
        towards the CEs) as well as the network service SLA and then proceeds 
        to configuring accordingly the end-to-end customer service between 
        the CEs in the case of an operator managed service. 

     A.1.1.   MDSC NBI 

        As explained in section 2, the OSS/Orchestration layer can request 
        the MDSC to setup L2/L3VPN network services (with or without TE 
        requirements). 

        Although the OSS/Orchestration layer interface is usually operator-
        specific, typically it would be using a RESTCONF/YANG interface with 
        a more abstracted version of the MPI YANG data models used for 
        network configuration (e.g. L3NM, L2NM). 

        Figure 12 shows an example of possible control flow between the 
        OSS/Orchestration layer and the MDSC to instantiate L2/L3 VPN network 
        services, using the YANG data models under the definition in [VN], 
        [RFC9291], [RFC9182] and [TSM].

        o  The VN YANG data model, defined in [VN], whose primary focus is 
           the CMI, can also provide VN Service configuration from an 
           orchestrated network service point of view when the L2/L3 VPN 
           network service has TE requirements. However, this model is not 
           used to setup L2/L3 VPN service with no TE requirements. 

            o It provides the profile of VN in terms of VN members, each of 
               which corresponds to an edge-to-edge link between customer 
               end-points (VNAPs). It also provides the mappings between the 
               VNAPs with the LTPs and the connectivity matrix with the VN 
               member. The associated traffic matrix (e.g., bandwidth, 
               latency, protection level, etc.) of VN member is expressed 
               (i.e., via the TE-topology’s connectivity matrix).  

            o The model also provides VN-level preference information (e.g., 
               VN member diversity) and VN-level admin-status and 
               operational-status.  

        o  The L2NM and L3NM YANG data models, defined in [RFC9291] and 
           [RFC9182], whose primary focus is the MPI, can also be used to 
           provide L2VPN and L3VPN network service configuration from a 
           orchestrated connectivity service point of view.  

        o  The TE & Service Mapping YANG data model [TSM] provides TE-service 
           mapping.

            o TE-service mapping provides the mapping between a L2/L3 VPN 
               instance and the corresponding VN instances.  

            o The TE-service mapping also provides the binding requirements 
               as to how each L2/L3 VPN/VN instance is created concerning the 
               underlay TE tunnels (e.g., whether they require a new and 
               isolated set of TE underlay tunnels or not).  

            o Site mapping provides the site reference information across 
               L2/L3 VPN Site ID, VN Access Point ID, and the LTP of the 
               access link. 

     A.2.  Multi-layer and Multi-domain Resiliency 

     A.2.1.   Maintenance Window 

        Before planned maintenance operation on DWDM network takes place, IP 
        traffic should be moved hitless to another link.  

        MDSC must reroute IP traffic before the events takes place. It should 
        be possible to lock IP traffic to the protection route until the 
        maintenance event is finished, unless a fault occurs on such path. 

     A.2.2.   Router Port Failure 

        The focus is on client-side protection scheme between IP router and 
        reconfigurable ROADM. Scenario here is to define only one port in the 
        routers and in the ROADM muxponder board at both ends as back-up 
        ports to recover any other port failure on client-side of the ROADM 
        (either on router port side or on muxponder side or on the link 
        between them). When client-side port failure occurs, alarms are 
        raised to MDSC by IP-PNC and O-PNC (port status down, LOS etc.). MDSC 
        checks with OP-PNC(s) that there is no optical failure in the optical 
        layer. 

        There can be two cases here:

        a) LAG was defined between the two end routers. MDSC, after checking 
           that optical layer is fine between the two end ROADMs, triggers 
           the ROADM configuration so that the router back-up port with its 
           associated muxponder port can reuse the OCh that was already in 
           use previously by the failed router port and adds the new link to 
           the LAG on the failure side. 
            
           While the ROADM reconfiguration takes place, IP/MPLS traffic is 
           using the reduced bandwidth of the IP link bundle, discarding 
           lower priority traffic if required. Once back-up port has been 
           reconfigured to reuse the existing OCh and new link has been added 
           to the LAG then original Bandwidth is recovered between the end 
           routers. 
            
           Note: in this LAG scenario let assume that BFD is running at LAG 
           level so that there is nothing triggered at MPLS level when one of 
           the link member of the LAG fails. 

        b) If there is no LAG then the scenario is not clear since a router 
           port failure would automatically trigger (through BFD failure) 
           first a sub-50ms protection at MPLS level :FRR (MPLS RSVP-TE case) 
           or TI-LFA (MPLS based SR-TE case) through a protection port. At 
           the same time MDSC, after checking that optical network connection 
           is still fine, would trigger the reconfiguration of the back-up 
           port of the router and of the ROADM muxponder to re-use the same 
           OCh as the one used originally for the failed router port. Once 
           everything has been correctly configured, MDSC Global PCE could 
           suggest to the operator to trigger a possible re-optimization of 
           the back-up MPLS path to go back to the  MPLS primary path through 
           the back-up port of the router and the original OCh if overall 
           cost, latency etc. is improved. However, in this scenario, there 
           is a need for protection port PLUS back-up port in the router 
           which does not lead to clear port savings. 

     A.3.  Muxponders 

        The setup of a client connectivity service between two transponders 
        is relatively clear and its implementation simple. 

        There is a one to one relationship between the tranponder’s client 
        and trunk (or DWDM) port. The client port bitrate determines the 
        trunk port bit rate which will also determine the Baud-rate, the 
        modulation format, the FEC etc.

        The controller, when asked to set up a client connectivity service, 
        needs to find a WDM tunnel suitable to comply the DWDM port 
        parameters. 

        The setup of a client connectivity service between two muxponders is 
        different since there is a one to many relationship between the 
        muxponder’s trunk (or DWDM) port and client ports. For example, there 
        might be a 100Gb/s trunk port shared by ten 10GE client ports. 

        The controller, when asked to set a 10GE client connectivity service 
        between two muxponder’s client ports, needs first to check whether 
        there is already an existing WDM tunnel between the two muxponders 
        and then take different actions: 

        1. if the WDM tunnel already exists, the controller needs only to 
           enable the 10GE client ports to establish the 10GE client 
           connectivity service; 

        2. if the WDM tunnel does not exist, the controller has to first 
           establish the WDM tunnel, finding a proper optical path matching 
           the optical parameters of the two muxponders’ trunk ports (e.g., 
           an OTSi carrying an OTU4), and then enable the 10GE client ports 
           to establish the 10GE client connectivity service. 

        Since multiple client connectivity services are sharing the same WDM 
        tunnel, a multiplexing label shall be assigned to each client 
        connectivity service. The multiplexing label can either be a standard 
        label (e.g., an OTN timeslot) or a vendor-specific label. The 
        multiplexing label can be either configurable (flexible 
        configuration) or assigned by design to each muxponder’s client port 
        (fixed configuration). In the former case, any muxponder client port 
        can be connected with any other client port of the peer muxponder 
        (for example client port 1 on one muxponder can be connected with 
        client port 5 on the peer muxponder) while in the latter case only 
        client ports with the same port number can be connected (for example 
        client port 2 on one muxponder can be connected only with client port 
        2 on the peer muxponder and not with any other client port). 

        In case of flexible configuration, since the two muxponders are under 
        the control of the same O-PNC, the configuration of the multiplexing 
        label, regardless of whether it is a standard or vendor-specific 
        label, can be done by the O-PNC using mechanisms which are vendor-
        specific and outside the scope of this document. The MDSC can just 
        request the O-PNC to setup a client connectivity service over a WDM 
        tunnel.

        In case of fixed configuration, the multiplexing label is assigned by 
        the muxponder but the O-PNC and MDSC needs to be aware of the 
        connectivity constraints to avoid try and fail. 

        It is worth noting that the current WSON and Flexi-grid topology 
        models in [RFC9094] and [Flexi-TOPO] do not provide sufficient 
        information to the MDSC about this connectivity constraint and this 
        is identified as a gap.
