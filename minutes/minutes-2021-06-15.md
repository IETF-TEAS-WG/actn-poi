## Discussion

### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

#### Binding SID: [Issue #54](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/54)

Drafted some slides on use of binding SID. The advantage of binding SID is to enable P-PNC to track the bandwidht taken by each multi-domain SR-TE path within its domain as well as to reduce the label stack required: [Comment #54-862710057](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/54#issuecomment-862710057)

The target is to describe the use of binding SID in the I-D update for IETF 111.

#### Text proposal: [PR #55](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/55)

Initial text proposal for section 4.2 submitted by Jeff, Paolo and Italo on github: [commit-89307ae](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/55/commits/89307ae022958c78d539582dc2125794b670c378)

- [ ] **Brent**: provides some slides to describe how TI-LFA can take into account multi-layer SRLG disjointness, providing that SRLG information is provided by the O-PNCs to the P-PNC throught the MDSC (after IETF-111): [Issue #56](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/56)
- [ ] **Italo**: organize some ad-hoc calls to progress the analysis of the L3VPN setup scenarios: [Issue #57](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/57)

#### ASCII figure for the L3VPN reference scenario: [Issue #53](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/53)
