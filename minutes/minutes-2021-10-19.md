## Discussion

### Service terminology (issue #33)

The text in draft PR #69 is aimed at using these terms in a consistent way:
- "network service" to represent the service request from an OSS/Orchestrator to an MDSC
- "MDSC needs to define the proper network configuration to realize the request network service"

Offline discussion with @jbouqui153 and @sergiobelotti confirmed this terminology

- [ ] @jbouqui153 provide some text proposal (one paragraph for the new A.1 section in PR #69) should be enough to clarify that customer service is from CE to CE while the “network service” is from PE to PE, including the configuration (on PE side) of the interface towards the CE. So OSS/Orchestration layer will request the “network service” to the MDSC and then will need to configure accordingly the CEs involved in the end-to-end customer service

### How MDSC trigger an IP Link setup (issue #4)

The text about the two workflows in section 2 needs to be updated since only discovery and L2/L3 VPN network service setup scenarios are in the scope.

### Examples for multi-domain/multi-layer optimizations (issue #68)

Considering issue #4, multi-layer/multi-domain optimizations are out of scope so no need to add examples.

### Optical Impairments Topology (issue #37)

Text proposal from Daniel with Italo comments accepted

This text can added after the clarification that partial summarization is assumed or when the YANG models at the MPI are described

- [ ] Italo: add this text within the draft PR #69

### LLDP snooping (issue #39)

Text proposal from Brent and Italo's comments have been reviewed

Comment 2: update the text to allow the option to use either the Chassis ID or the System Name ID

Comment 3 and 4: ok

Comment 5: the optional System Capabilities field can be used, the R means Router

The issue in comment 5 needs further discussion/investigation

- [ ] Italo: provide more details on the issue with plug-id and check with the TE Topology model (RFC8795) authors for some guidance

### Comments from Victor/Oscar (PR #70)

Editorial comments from Victor and Oscar to be reviewed offline

### Text review (PR #69)

Review still on-goin (PR in draft status): daily updates are committed when available

Section 2 does not need to be too long and the relevant material for L2/L3 VPN setup could be moved to section 4 (if not already present)
