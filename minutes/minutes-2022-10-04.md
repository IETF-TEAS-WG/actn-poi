### Review of the minutes of the latest Slot 1 calls

Minutes of the call on September 27, 2022 reviewed: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2022-09-27.md

### Closed Issues

None

### Next calls

- October 11th at 4:30am NA EDT / 10:30am CEST / 4:30pm CST (Slot 1)
- October 18th at 11am NA EDT / 5pm CEST / 11pm CST (Slot 2)

November 1st is a National holidays in some countries (e.g., Spain, Italy), so the call planned on November 1st has been cancelled

The deadline for IETF 115 I-D submission is October 24, 2022 so the call planned on October 25th has been cancelled

## Discussion

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

> - [x] **Italo**: invite the TEAS WG chairs to join the slot 2 call on October 4th to address their comments

Not available this week: will invite them for the week on October 18th. If there is not enough time to finish the draft before IET 115, we can report the status of the discussion at IETF 115 and update the draft before IETF 116

- [ ] **Italo**: invite the TEAS WG chairs to join the slot 2 call on October 18th to address their comments

### Standard reference for TI-LFA local protection (issue #95)

> - [x] Brent will add reference to TI-LFA and update the comment.

- [ ] **Italo**: update the draft with the standard reference

### September updates (PR #101)

- [ ] Italo: solicit feedbacks to Sergio and Pransenjing by end of this week

### P-PNC awareness of underlying Optical tunnels' SRLGs (issue #45)

The MDSC can write the SRLGs of the underlay optical path in the running DS for the IP link wihtin the te-srlgs and te-nsrlgs lists

The P-PNC can report in the operational DS these configured SRLGs plus additional SRLG it can discover within the packet domain

Jeff: is it possible the MDSC to request the O-PNC to setup an optical tunnel with disjoint SRLG than another tunnel?

In the current TE tunnel model it is possible to request the setup of secondary paths which are node/link/SRLG disjoint from the primary path within the same tunnel but it seems not possible to request the setup of two paths belonging to two different tunnels

With path computation it is possible to request the computation of two disjoint paths even if they belong to two different tunnels using the synchronization container

The example in https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/6665830/Multi_Layer_SRLG.pptx has been analyzed

The example is assuming the colored optics in the router. In case of grey interface, the "Add/Drop SRLG" can be renamed as "Transponder SRLG"

The O-PNC can report the list of the optical tunnel SRLGs which include Conduit SRLG, Transponder SRLG, ROADM degree SRLG and ROADM node SRLG

The MDSC configures this values for the overlay IP link

The P-PNC will report the SRLGs of this IP link adding the Line Card SRLG to the list configured by the MDSC

The list of SRLGs for an optical tunnel can be quite a long list. Being able to deal with such a long list is an implementation issue and therefore outside the scope of the document.

The SRLG of an optical tunnel are reported by the O-PNC to the MDSC within the path-srlg-lists (computed-path-properties), for each path. In case the optical tunnel is configured with protection or restoration, the translation of the optical paths SRLG into IP link SRLG list is a matter of MDSC policy and the list of SRLGs configured by the MDSC to the P-PNC can also change dynamically when the optical path changes:
