- [ ] **Italo**: discuss the comments offline with Daniel

After the comments have been reviewed with Daniel, the PR can be merged and the updated text can be used as the basis for the next editorial work.

### Mix of fixed and flexi grid DWDM networks (issue #100)

Jeff: we can also identify this as a gap of existing YANG models

### Appendix B.2: Add TXP sub-case and clarify "OCh-CC" (adjacency) changes (issue #29)

> - [ ] **Italo**: Update the appendices as agreed and incorporate the text proposed by Gabriele in appendix A.3

To be done in the next editorial update

> - [ ] **Jeff, Fabio**: check whether it is worthwhile analyzing the muxponder scenario in this document or in a future document

Jeff: we should consider both transponder and muxponder scenarios.

Daniele: what would be the significant changes from transponder and muxponder?

Italo: the workflow would be different since there will be a N:1 relationship between the IP Links and the underlay Optical Tunnels

Check if it is enough just to mention that the analysis can also apply to the muxponder case but that in that case the workflow would be different since there a relationship between the IP Links and the underlay Optical Tunnels

In the appendix we can explain in more details the differences in the workflows
