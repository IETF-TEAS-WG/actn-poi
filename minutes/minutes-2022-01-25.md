## Discussion

### LAG (issue #5 and #74)

> - [x] Jeff/Fabio: to check whether LAG is still a priority for high capacity interfaces (100G and above)

Jeff: in general it is not really recommended to have LAG on NNI interfaces (between routers) and with the evolution beyond 100G, LAG is not recommended

Fabio: use LAG between routers and WDM only to increase the bandwidth and not for resiliency. To be further investigated if LAG is used between routers

The agreement to keep LAG out of scope for this draft version (draft PR #69) and to add it in a later revision of the document before WG LC has been confirmed. Need to further investigate whether to describe the use of LAG only for multi-layer IP links or also for direct interconnection between routers

- [ ] Fabio: to check if LAG is used also between routers
