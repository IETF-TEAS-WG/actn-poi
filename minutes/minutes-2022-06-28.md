IETF 114 cut-off deadline is July 11th: plan for a revised I-D published with:
- LAG description added
- discovery scenario description updated
- SR-TE path description generalized as per comment at IETF 113

Plan for IETF 115 update (to share at IETF 114):
- describe transparent optical services instead of Ethernet frame-based services
- complete description of multi-layer SRLG
- terminology clean-up

- [ ] Italo: request a presentation slot for IETF 114

### LLDP snooping with LAG (issue #74)

> - [x] Brent: further investigate this issue

Analysis provided: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/74#issuecomment-1164588798

The cross-layer link discovery is based only on the LLDP packets being sent on the LAG members (Aggregation Ports).

LLDP can be enabled on LAG members (Aggregation Ports) as well as on LAG groups (Aggregated Ports). If LLDP is enabled on both LAG members and groups, two types of LLDP packets are transmitted on some Ethernet interfaces from the routers and received by the ROADMs: one sent on the LAG member (Aggregation Port) and one sent on the LAG group (Aggregated Port)

To avoid this ambiguity, one possibility is to disable LLDP for the LAG group and enable LLDP only for the LAG members. This should not be an issue since the LAG group is configured by the MDSC.

Another option is to rely on other mechanisms (e.g., the Port type field in the Link Aggregation TLV defined in Annex F of IEEE 8012.1AX-2015) that allow the ROADM identify which LLDP packets have been transmitted on the LAG member (Aggregation Port) or on the LAG group (Aggregated Port).

- [ ] Italo: update the text in PR#90 accordingly

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

> - [x] Italo: send the mail to TEAS WG (after review)

Mail sent on June 1st: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/teas/CjulOXJK6jTG0JtDsSsWRUbyIBs/

No feedbacks from the mailing list so we can assumed the proposal has been accepted by the WG

> - [X] Italo: Update the draft text based on the comment resolution

Draft PR#94 prepared (txt file to be generated) and reviewed during the call

- [ ] Italo: update the text as discussed and add the text file and open the PR
- [ ] Brent/Paolo/Sergio: review the PR by the end of this week
- [ ] Brent/Paolo: check whether the text in PR#94 can also close issue #91

### Update L3VPN figure (issue #82)

> - [x] Gabriele: split the ASCII art figure into two figures, one showing the links and another one showing the paths


Updated figure provided by Gabriele: [ASCII drawings for POI-v2.txt](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/9008324/ASCII.drawings.for.POI-v2.txt)

The figure has been reviewed and updated during the call: [ASCII drawings for POI-v3.txt](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/9008331/ASCII.drawings.for.POI-v3.txt)

- [ ] Gabriele: remove the links from the second figure (showing only the paths) and use different conventions to differentiate the two paths
