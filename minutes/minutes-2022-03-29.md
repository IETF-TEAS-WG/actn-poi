## Discussion

### Report of IETF 113 discussion

Notes from the meeting are available: https://notes.ietf.org/notes-ietf-113-teas

Recording of the meeting also available: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5T4Ca-KT3I4

Concerns raised about the focus only on SR-TE

Suggestion from Pavan:

> Pavan Beeram: The ideal scenario would be to describe the procedures in a path-control-technology (RSVP/SR) agnostic way and then add technology specific examples wherever there is a deviation.

It is not clear how RSVP-TE can be used end-to-end. One possibility is to do LSP stitching

Jeff: RSVP-TE end-to-end is not widely used in the network. Usually BGP-LU is used with RSVP-TE

Daniele: there are two BGP extensions for multi-domain services which are better fitting when there is a need to map a service with an LSP: BGP-CT (classfull transport) and BGP-CAR (color-aware routing)

We can update the text to generalize RSVP-TE and SR-TE end-to-end descriptions even though the procedures will be most likely used for SR-TE end-to-end: issue #88 created to track this issue

To be discussed also with Brent next week and, if needed, we can trigger some more discussion on the TEAS WG mailing list regarding the proposal to generalize the description of RSVP-TE and SR-TE end-to-end, leaving the BGP-LU outside the scope of the document

No comments on the description for the intra-domain IP link configuration: issue #81 has been closed accordingly

## Plan for next steps

- Review of the Discovery Scenario Description (issue #19): Jeff B. will review and provide comments
- generalization of the SR-TE and RSVP-TE descriptions: to be discussed next week
- provisioning of LAG (issue #5 and issue #74): prepare some text proposal by April 12th
