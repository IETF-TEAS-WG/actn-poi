## Discussion

### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

Reviewed slides from Brent: [#38-854787366](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38#issuecomment-854787366)

Comments:
* the slide describes the scenario where MDSC delegates intra-domain path computation to the P-PNC. The case where the MDSC performs end-to-end path computation would have only the steps 7 and 8 described in the slides
* it is not clear how P-PNC 200 can be made aware of the bandwidth allocated to the end-to-end SR-TE path initiated within P-PNC 100
* an alternative solution could be to use the binding SID: this would address also the issue above

- [ ] **Brent**: Provide a slide with Binding SID scenario [#54](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/54)

It was confirmed the agreement that for IETF 111 the target is to provide text and analysis for the end-to-end SR-TE scenario where the multi-layer/multi-domain path computation is performed by the MDSC without relying on intra-domain path computation being performed by the P-PNCs. Still to be discussed whether to consider the binding SID approach or not.

However, it is still worth exploring the possibility to rely on P-PNC for intra-domain path computation for future updates of the draft after IETF 111

No progress has been made on the text proposal for the draft. The latest raw text is provided in: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/6538270/draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability-l3vpn%402021-05-25.docx

- [ ] **Italo/Paolo/Jeff:** prepare some initial text proposal for the draft about L3VPN scenario

- [ ] **All**: review the current raw text proposal and provide feedbacks for the next week call

### P-PNC awareness of underlaying Optical tunnels' SRLGs ([Issue #45](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/45))

The MDSC could retrieve the optical tunnel SRLG from the O-PNC and provide them to the P-PNC
