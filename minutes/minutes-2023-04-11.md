## Feedbacks from IETF 116

Discussion in TEAS WG about whether to have a separated document for service assurance or merging the content in the current draft

Agreed that the duplicated text should be removed (see new issue #7) and more material should be added to show the need for a new document

Comment in CCAMP WG about the possibility to generalize the description to cover other similar cases (e.g., channelized OTN interfaces on the routers)

Jeff concerns about whether this is making the analysis more complex: to be further discussed with other operators

## Discussion (POI Pluggable)

Need to start some discussion about adding option 1 from TIP MANTRA

The document can describe the two options and reference the TIP white paper (informative reference)

## Discussion (POI Applicability)

### Check with SPRING the use of TE tunnel for SR-TE (issue #87)

The issue has been closed: the document is identifying a gap. Addressing this gap is outside the scope of the document.
