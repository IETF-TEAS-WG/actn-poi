## Discussion

### Plan for IETF 114 (issue #97)

The updated discovery scenario description has been postponed to IETF 115.

The milestone for issues #19 and #82 has been moved to IETF 115.

The plan is to publish a revised I-D with:
- LAG description added
- discovery scenario description updated

Oscar: would be useful to add examples for API calls/workflows (e.g., JSON code)

The examples are quite useful but would make the document even bigger (see for example the TNBI document developed at CCAMP WG): it may be worthwhile raising the question at the TEAS WG during IETF 114

Plan for IETF 115 update (to share at IETF 114):
- describe transparent optical services instead of Ethernet frame-based services
- complete description of multi-layer SRLG
- terminology clean-up
- need to API calls/workflows (e.g., JSON code)?

The slides will be reviewed offline

### LAG description (PR #90)

Text proposal finalized in PR#90

> - [x] Fabio, Jeff and Paolo: review the PR by the end of this week (July 1st)

Review comments submitted and reviewed during the call

Oscar noted that when a LAG group is configured by the MDSC, some additional LAG-specific parameters can be configured. For example, the minimum number of LAG members that should be active to consider the LAG group active.

This is a gap to be addressed in the Ethernet TE topology model under definition in CCAMP

- [ ] Italo: add some text to the document to describe this gap (issue #98)

- [ ] Italo: update the text based on the review comments and merge the PR

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (PR #94)

> - [x] Italo: update the text as discussed and add the text file and open the PR

Done: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/commit/4be2e2b050f89ee306e4d82a7dd71609723ef83c
