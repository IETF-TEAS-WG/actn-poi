## Document re-structuring (new ToC)

The interface between OSS/Orchestration has been discussed via mail

Paolo has shown some slides summarizing the industry landscape as well as MEF and ETSI 3GPP architectures

Sergio has pointed out the on-going work in the NSDT within TEAS WG to standardize the TS NBI between the the TN NSSMF and the E2E slice orchestrator NSMF. In the context of ACTN, the TN NSSMF seems matching with the MDSC while the NFMF seems matching with the PNC. 

From this presentation as well as some feedbacks from Yanlei and Jeff B., it seems that there are multiple architectures/SDOs defining specific aspects of the orchestration but not a complete/harmonized viewpoint. Therefore, the MDSC NBI is usually operator-specific even though sometimes it wuold based on some standard YANG models (with specific customization).

We can conclude that:
- besides CMI and MPI, MDSC could support other types of NBIs;
- these interfaces are usually operator-specific;
- in current network deployment, MDSC usually interacts with OSS/Orchestrator through these interfaces, rather than directly with the customer (via CMI);
- we can assume in the POI draft that the OSS/Orchestrator requests MDSC to setup L2VPN/L3VPN services through mechanisms which are outside the scope of the draft.

It is worthwhile noting that the interface between Service-related functions and Network-related functions in figure 5 of RFC8453

The focus of the ACTN POI draft is to analyse the applicability of the IETF YANG models at the MPIs between MDSC and both Optical and IP PNCs.

Paolo has updated the slides based on the feedbacks on this call and uploaded the latest version on github: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/4982410/Comparison_short_v3.pptx

Work plan:
- Italo/Sergio/Paolo to provide some text proposal for completing section 2
- All to review the proposal for section 2 and provide feedbacks before the call on September 7

The latest draft is available on github: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/tree/new-toc

Next calls:
- August 4 at 5pm CEST
- September 7 at 11am CEST
