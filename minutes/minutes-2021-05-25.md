### Use of kramdown

In previous meetings it has been proposed to use kramdown instead of Word as the tool to prepare the draft

An experiment has been done to see how the current draft would be in kramdown: [PR#48](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/48)

The only drawback of kramdown is that the syntax is not documented so some experiments are needed (also searching from other kramdown drafts) 

The advantages are that the syntax is much lighter than XML and, like XML, being an ASCII file could be better integrated with github to track changes and proposed text changes (pull request)

Discussed during the meeting: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/48#issuecomment-847717445

> Concerns raised with the issues in installing the new tool (not working on all the machines)
> 
> For the time being we will continue using Word to avoid the need to install new tools.

- Daniel: provide a review before July 5
