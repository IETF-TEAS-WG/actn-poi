### Use of kramdown

In previous meetings it has been proposed to use kramdown instead of Word as the tool to prepare the draft

An experiment has been done to see how the current draft would be in kramdown: [PR#48](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/48)

The only drawback of kramdown is that the syntax is not documented so some experiments are needed (also searching from other kramdown drafts) 

The advantages are that the syntax is much lighter than XML and, like XML, being an ASCII file could be better integrated with github to track changes and proposed text changes (pull request)

Discussed during the meeting: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/48#issuecomment-847717445

> Concerns raised with the issues in installing the new tool (not working on all the machines)
> 
> For the time being we will continue using Word to avoid the need to install new tools.

### Plan for IETF 111

Daniel has volounteered to have a full review of the -03 draft before submitting it to IETF.

Possible plan for an update at IETF 111:
- All: prepare a -03 draft for IETF 110 before June 28
- Daniel: provide a review before July 5
- Italo: submit the -03 draft on July 12 (cut-off dealine for IETF 111)

Created milestone on github: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/milestone/2 to track this plan

[Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38) assigned to this milestone: the objective is to provide some initial text to analyze the end-to-end SR-TE scenario with partial summarization
