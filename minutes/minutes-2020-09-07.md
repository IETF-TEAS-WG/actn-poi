# ACTN POI bi-weekly call (September 7, 2020)

## Participants

- Jeff Bouquier
- Paolo Volpato

## Review of the minutes of the last call (August 4. 2020)

No comments to the minutes.

## WG Adoption

The draft has been accepted as a WG document: official announcement sent on TEAS WG mailing list on September 4, 2020.

There are pending comments from Dhruv:
- one regarding the relationship with PCE and PCEP in the context of inter-layer (RFC8637 is dealing with applicability of PCEP to ACTN): to be discussed
- another in the context of section 5: this comment can be addressed with the on-going restructuring of the document content

Some doubts about whether the comment is considering using PCEP on SBI or MPI.

MDSC will talk with PNC using Restconf/YANG and, depending on the PNC implementation, some implementations may use PCEP or Netconf/YANG or other mechanisms at SBI (between PNC and NEs).

Need to have a look at RFC8637 and then discuss the comment with Dhruv.

Since the document is now a WG item, we can open the calls to the whole TEAS WG and use the TEAS WG Webex account to host the next calls.

**Actions:**
- Sergio: create a github issue to track the first comment from Dhruv
- Italo: ask Pavan for setting up Webex sessions for the whole TEAS WG
