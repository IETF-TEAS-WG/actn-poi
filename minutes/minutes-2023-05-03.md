## Discussion (POI Assurance)

### Scenarios from TIM (issue #1)

Reviewed slides from Fabio: [2023.03.draft-poidt-teas-poi-assurance.pptx](https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance/files/10885907/2023.03.draft-poidt-teas-poi-assurance.pptx)


#### slide 3 (Failure within the optical network)

An alternative option is to rely on optical protection switching which can take less than 50ms to recover from the failure. In this case, we need to slow down the FRR trigger in the router (e.g., setting the hold-off timer for IP FRR).

- [ ] Italo: check if RFC8795 has enough information for the MDSC to inform the P-PNC that the IP link is protected

This is a protection/restoration coordination use case where the link goes down because the optical is unprotected

The other case is protection coordination where IP FRR shall be delayed to avoid protection switching at both IP and optical layers

Need to distinguish two different sub-cases:
- when the optical path is protected (below 50ms);
- when the optical path is restored or unprotected

The IP router needs to be informed about this type of configuration

Although the mechanism used to protect within the optical domain is vendor-specific, the behavior of the optical protection switching at the MPI should be the same across multiple vendors

#### Slide 4 (Maintenance within the optical network)

Julien noted that to lock the IP traffic to the protection path the graceful shutdown option can be used

The description of how the IP traffic is locked can be generalized investigating whether there is a common way to inform the P-PNC on the need to lock the IP traffic on the protection path

Oscar: we should just say that the link is under maintenance and let the P-PNC take the proper action

Aihua: RFC8795 has already a mechanism to provide this information
