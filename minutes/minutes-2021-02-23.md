## Discussion

### L3VPN

#### [Jeff B. Presentation](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/6031172/IETF.draft.POI.v02.discussions.on.scenario.4.2.v092.Sent.pptx)

Jeff B.: from operational perspective, it is preferable not to have the cross-links between the BRs to avoid forward/reverse paths being disjoint

Brent: other operators are using cross-links

We can consider the cross-link possibility in the draft. From path-computation/TE perspective there is no difference.

Seamless MPLS can work with any scenario:
- RSVP-TE/RSVP-TE
- RSVP-TE/SR-TE
- SR-TE/SR-TE

E2E SR works only with SR-TE/SR-TE: binding SID may not be needed in the simple ACTN POI scenario with direct BR interconnection; node SID and EPE could be sufficient (to be furhter checked)

An ad-hoc call to continue the discussion has been setup next tuesday, March 2nd, at 4:30-5:30pm CET

### Plan for IETF 111

Daniel has volounteer to have a full review of the -02 draft before submitting it to IETF.

Possible plan for an update at IETF 111:
- All: prepare a -02 draft for IETF 110 before June 28
- Daniel: provide a review before July 5
- Italo: submit the -02 draft on July 12 (expected cut-off dealine for IETF111, not yet announced)

## Next calls:
- March 2nd at 4:30pm CET (ad-hoc)
- March ~~8th~~**15th** at 11am CET (Slot 1)
- March 23rd at 5pm CET (Slot 2)
