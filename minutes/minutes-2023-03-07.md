The I-D submission cut-off for IETF 116 is March 13

- [ ] **Italo**: poll regular participants on Monday March 13 to check if there is anything on the agenda for discussion. If no topic requires discussion, the call will be cancelled.

We can setup an ad-hoc call on March 21st to review the slides in slot 2 at 5pm CET

- [ ] **Gabriele**: send Webex invitation to regular participants

### Preparation for IETF 116

It is too late to update the I-D for IETF 116. Next update planned for IETF 117.

Moved all the issues with an agreed resolution, including PR #106, from the 'IETF 116' milestone to a new 'IETF 117' milestone

The issues marked with 'IETF 116' are the open issues that need to be addressed before completing PR #106: the plan is to get an agreement on these issues before or right after IETF 116

It is worthwhile discussing with TEAS WG the following issues:
- detailed examples (#102)
- type of SRLG (#45)
- transparent services (#36)

These issues can be presented in the same presentation together with the new use cases for POI service assurance

- [ ] **Italo**: check with Daniel and request a presentation slot to TEAS WG
