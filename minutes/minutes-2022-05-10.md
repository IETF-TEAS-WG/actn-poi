## Discussion

### LAG (issue #5 and issue #74)

> - [x] Fabio: to check if LAG is used also between routers

> - [x] Jeff/Italo: To check about the requirement to support the configuration of the LAG after the IP link has been created without LAG

Checked offline with Fabio:
- LAG can be used also between routers (i.e., on single-layer ETH links);
- within the same P-PNC domain, links with and without LAG can co-exist: when setting up a new multi-layer IP link, the MDSC decides whether it should use or not LAG;
- it could be possible that LAG can be configured also after the IP link has been setup without LAG.

Proposal:
- describe the discovery of the LAG for any (single-layer and multi-layer) intra-domain link, since the mechanism is the same;
- mention that LAG can also be used on inter-domain links but do not describe the discovery of LAG on inter-domain links since it has no multi-layer aspects (out-of-scope);
- describe the setup of the LAG for multi-layer intra-domain links only and update the procedure describe in the current draft to allow the co-existence of IP links with and without LAG:
  - after a multi-layer ETH link is discovered/configured, the P-PNC has not enough information to know whether the MDSC intention is to support an IP link over this ETH link or to create a new LAG group using this ETH link or to add this ETH link to an existing LAG group: as a consequence, the discovery/configuration of the ETH link is not sufficient to trigger the P-PNC to configure an IP link (as written in the current draft);
  - the MDSC can trigger the P-PNC to configure an IP link by creating this IP link, within the IP topology at the MPI, without configuring it: this would trigger the P-PNC to configure the IP link
- describe the procedure to setup a LAG also after the IP link has been created.

Need to clarify in the draft whether all the information that is needed to trigger the P-PNC to configure a new IP link is available, at the MPI, in the current YANG models

- [ ] Swomy to further investigate the YANG models at the MPI that could be used to trigger P-NC to setup a new IP link

Jeff: usually when LAG is desired, a LAG group with one link is created to allow adding new members when needed. Adding LAG after the IP link is setup is a quite disruptive process. The scenario to add LAG after the IP link is setup is a niche use case

Agreement to mention the option but not to describe it in details
