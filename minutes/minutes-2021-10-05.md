Feedbacks from Michael and Adrian on TEAS WG mailing list

We can start referencing LLDP standard and describe the information that is needed for snooping

If in future a draft on LLDP snooping draft is submitted we can add a reference to it

#### Applicability of L2NM and L3NM YANG models #34

Jeff B.: the L2NM/L3NM are applicable at the MPI between the MDSC and the PNC even if the PEs are located in multiple PNC domains
The MDSC needs to discover the UNI links and the PE nodes where to configure the VRFs (UNI topology discovery as per issue #31)
