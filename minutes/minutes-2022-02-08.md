### Review of the minutes of the latest Slot 1 calls

Slot 1 call on February 1st has been cancelled

### Closed Issues

None

### IETF 113 preparation

Deadline for IETF 113 I-D submission is March 7, 2022

Target: submit the -05 revision based on PR #69

Next update planned for IETF 114

It would be useful to request a presentation slot:
- the list of identified gaps is quite clear now
- it is now clear that we are considering SR-TE end-to-end

Oscar: would it be worthwhile presenting it also in SPRING? Focus on the requirements and get feedbacks

- [ ] @oscargdd : have some offline discussion with SPRING people to start sharing the issue

- [ ] @italobusi @oscargdd @sergiobelotti : check with Pavan on TEAS Friday call

New issue #75 opened on github

### Next calls

- February 15th at 4:30am NAEST / 10:30am CET / 5:30pm CST (Slot 1)
- February 22nd at 11am NAEST / 5pm CET / midnight CST (Slot 2)
- March 1st at 4:30am NAEST / 10:30am CET / 5:30pm China (Slot 1)

We can stop weekly call after March 1st and resume the weekly calls after IETF 113

The presentation slides can be reviewed offline and, if needed, ad-hoc calls can be scheduled on demand

## Discussion

### SR-TE traffic steering on a device (issue #72)

Brent's presentation: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/72#issuecomment-1032884525

Oscar: there are YANG models defined in IETF for the device configuration but it is not precluded to use them at the NBI of a controller:
- routing policy: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9067
- BGP standard community: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-idr-bgp-model

In L3NM, some placeholder for policies have been left. The typical use of route policies is to accept or reject routes but they could also be used to set the standard community colors.

An alternative approach could be to infer the policy from the TE service mapping configuration, but the TSM does not allow fine grained policy configuration: only one SR policy can be configured for each pair of PEs

- [ ] @oscargdd @jbouqui153 : further investigate which model could be applied at the MPI
