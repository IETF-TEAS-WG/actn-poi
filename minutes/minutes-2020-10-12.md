## Agenda items

### ToC Restructuring ([PR#28](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/28))

Comments from Gabriele about Appendix A.2: in case of a router port failure with no LAG, even if the OCh is not affected, the IP Link still needs to be re-configured since the router ports are changed. A similar issue applies to the LAG member in the case of LAG.

This would require some analysis on the YANG models being used to configure the IP Link over a WDM Tunnel, including the configuration of the WDM links.

- [ ] __Gabriele__: check if some IP experts can also join the work\
