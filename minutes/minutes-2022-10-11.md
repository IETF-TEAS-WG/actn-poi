## Discussion

### P-PNC awareness of underlying Optical tunnels' SRLGs (issue #45)

- [ ] **Italo**: add some text to describe, as a gap, the fact that the TE tunnel model does not allow requesting the setup of disjoint paths that belong to different TE tunnels

By looking at the SRLG value it is not possible to know whether a given SRLG is a Conduit SRLG, Transponder SRLG, ROADM degree SRLG or ROADM node SRLG. For the scope of the SRLG disjointness path computation this might not be an issue but there are cases where the operator is willing to know the type of SRLG

We have noted that the ietf-te YANG model supports the named-slrg definition but would like to get more information about how its use and also the definition of the cost associated with an SRLG

- [ ] **Italo**: send a mail to the TEAS WG to get more information about this issue

### Appendix B.2: Add TXP sub-case and clarify "OCh-CC" (adjacency) changes (issue #29)

> - [x] **Gabriele** will submit a text proposal to be reviewed by all.

Appendix A.2 is now Appendix B.2: the title of the issue has been changed accordingly

The text looks ok (with some wordsmithing required) but it is not clear how it fits into the scope of appendix B.2 (router port failure)

The use of muxponders is an additional scenario which has been considered during the work but considered outside the scope of this document (like the content of appendix A and B)

We can merge appendices A and B into one appendix "Additional Scenarios":

```
A.1     OSS/Orchestration Layer
  A.1.1 MDSC NBI
A.2 Multi-layer and multi-domain resiliency
A.3 Muxponders
```

- [ ] **Italo**: Update the appendices as agreed and incorporate the text proposed by Gabriele in appendix A.3

Operators are using also muxponders in their networks so the scenario of muxponder is of clear interest to be analyzed either in this document or in a future document

We can check in parallel whether it is straightforward adding the muxponder analysis to this document or whether it is better to postpone its analysis to a future document

- [ ] **Jeff/Fabio**: check whether it is worthwhile analyzing the muxponder scenario in this document or in a future document

### Additional parameters for LAG configuration (issue #98)

> Really LAG required? We need to clarify better, need more discussion on this

LAG is used, as an alternative approach to ECMP, to support IP links with higher bandwidth (e.g., Nx100G links)

- [ ] **Italo/Fabio/Prasenjit**: check if some text can be added to the document to clarify the need for LAG

### September updates (PR #101)

> - [x] Italo: solicit feedbacks to Sergio and Prasenjit by end of this week

Issue #103 has been created to track the comment about BGP-LS: to be discussed also with Brent next week

- [ ] **Italo/Sergio**: address Sergio review comments offline
