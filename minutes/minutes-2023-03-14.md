- [ ] **Italo**: Ask the TEAS WG chairs to setup new series for the ACTN POI weekly calls after IETF 116 (issue #111)

## Discussion (Pluggable)

It has been agreed to align the terminology of the draft with the terminology used in the current POI draft and with other IETF drafts (e.g., optical impairments)

The terminology used in IETF for the optical layer is aligned with the ITU-T terminology but not always aligned with Openconfig terminology. It would be good to have some guidelines describing how the terminology used by Openconfig aligns with the terminology used by IETF:
- one option is to write a terminology draft
- another option is to add an appendix to the DWDM interface model draft

The analysis provided in this draft is more generic than POI and applies to any scenario where the DCO and the OLS are under different controllers (PNCs): the draft analysis will stay focused on POI, to keep consistency/alignment with other POI work, but some text will be added to the draft describing the generality of the approach

TIP MANTRA describe two options to manage these scenarios. The draft is analyzing only one option, the one in which hierarchical controller only is managing e2e service. It might be worthwhile considering both options (second option?) in the next updates to the draft

- [ ] **Gabriele**: to prepare a list of open issues to share during the IETF 116 presentation (issue #2)
