## Discussion

### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

Closed [Issue #66](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/66): BGP-LU for multi-domain L3VPN

- [ ] **Italo/Victor/Oscar**: Review current L3VPN text to check if anything is missing or requires clarification, in particular the analysis of the YANG data models to be used at the MPI and if there are any gaps: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/67

Discussion has already started within the TE experts in TEAS on how to augment the TE tunnel model to support SR-TE: https://github.com/tsaad-dev/te/issues/168

### Review of the open issues

#### [Issue #4](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/4)

- [ ] **Italo**: check if the current draft text is fine or something is still missing

#### [Issue #31](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/31)

- [ ] **Oscar**: provide updates on the UNI topology discovery discussion

#### [Issue #32](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/32)

Closed: to be addressed in another document, if required

#### [Issue #34](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/34)

Oscar: the LxNM draft does not preclude the applicability of LxNM at the NBI of the MDSC.

Jeff: we think it is possible to use a "simplified" version of LxNM

Oscar: maybe it is possible to develop a profile of LxNM for the MDSC NBI. Some analysis has to be done to check which part of these models are applicable at the MDSC NBI.

The applicability of LxNM to configure multi-domain LxVPN at the MPI needs further analysis

- [ ] Need for volounteers to perform this analysis

#### [Issue #39](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/39)

- [ ] **Italo**: check with the TEAS WG how to deal with the informative references on LLDP snooping

#### [Issue #40](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/40), [Issue #41](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/41) and [Issue #42](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/42)

These issues are waiting for a more stable version of the draft

### Other topics

Victor: there are no clear examples/guidelines of when to use TE tunnel model with compute-only flag or the Path Computation RPC
