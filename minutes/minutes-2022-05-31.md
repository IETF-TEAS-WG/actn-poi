### Plan for IETF 114

The main objective for the IETF 114 updated is to add the analysis of the LAG scenario and to update:
- the description of the SR-TE tunnel procedure to address the comment received at IETF 113 (make it more generic)
- the description of the WDM services to be transparent rather than frame-based

The following issues have been postponed for IETF 115: #89, #83, #80, #78, #72, #45 and #29

Work on these issues can be started before IETF 114, time permitting
