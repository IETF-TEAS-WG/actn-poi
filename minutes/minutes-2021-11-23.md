### Review current L3VPN text (issue #67)

Per-destination steering (section 8.4 of draft-ietf-spring-segment-routing-policy-08) describes the behavior used by the ingress PE to steer the ingress traffic to an SR policy

Jeff: in TSM, it is possible to indicate the SR policy for a LxVPN

It seems the relationship between TE tunnel and SR policy in TSM

More investigation is needed to understand the relationship between TE tunnel and SR policy YANG models and their usage with TSM

There is an on-going discussion within the TEAS WG modelling team about this:
