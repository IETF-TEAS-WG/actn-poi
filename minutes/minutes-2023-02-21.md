Done during the call: https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance

> The plan is to start from an existing repository which provides automatic tool for uploading the I-D directly from github: Oscar will help us on setting up these two repositories during the next call (February 21st)

Oscar has given a tutorial about how to create a new github repository starting from a template github repository: https://github.com/martinthomson/internet-draft-template

From this repository it is possible to create a new repository starting from this template

NOTE: need to flag the "Include all branches"

See the instructions at: https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/TEMPLATE.md

The repository is automatically performing CI on the markdown but not on the YANG file
