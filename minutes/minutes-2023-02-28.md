## Discussion

### ACTN POI Next Steps

> - [ ] **Gabriele**: start a new repository for draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable 

Setup of the new repository is still on-going

Jeff: how to proceed for the next steps? Continue with the current calls or setup new calls

We can alternate the focus of the alternate calls:
- Slot 1 calls focused on draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable
- Slot 2 calls focused on draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance

The agenda of the calls can be adjusted based on the open issues, taking into account that some time still needs to be reserved to progress the current ACTN POI draft

The deadline for the I-D cutoff is March 13. Plan for the two new drafts:
- fix the file and post to github by March 7
- review the text by March 9
- update the draft by March 10
- post on IETF by March 13

Jeff: for the other draft, an important topic is the correlation of the alarms and performance data at the PNC level not to expose all the alarms and performance data to the PNC.

For fault management, the initial reference can be [RFC8632](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8632) 

For performance monitoring, the initial reference can be [draft-yu-performance-monitoring-yang](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-yu-performance-monitoring-yang)

Proposal for IETF 116 presentation(s):
- present draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable to CCAMP WG
- present draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance to TEAS WG
- have one or two common slides to describe the relationship between all the drafts
