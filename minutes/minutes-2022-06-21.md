## Discussion

### LAG (issue #5)

Text proposal finalized in PR#90

Fabio, Jeff and Paolo have volunteered to review the PR

### LLDP snooping with LAG (issue #74)

> - [x] Brent: check that it is possible to configure LLDP snooping on each member of the LAG

It seems that on one interface two LLDP packets are sent: one for the LAG and one for the interface

It is not very clear how the transponder can distinguish which LLDP packet can be used for adjacency discovery and therefore which LLDP information the O-PNC has to report to the MDSC for the discovery of the cross-layer links

One possibility could be to disable sending LLDP packets on the LAG group so only the LLDP packets used to discover the LAG members are received by the ROADMs

- [ ] Brent: further investigate this issue

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

> - [x] Italo: send the mail to TEAS WG (after review)

Mail sent on June 1st: https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/teas/CjulOXJK6jTG0JtDsSsWRUbyIBs/

No feedbacks from the mailing list so we can assumed the proposal has been accepted by the WG

> - [ ] Italo: Update the draft text based on the comment resolution

### Check SR description covers both SR-MPLS and SRv6 (issue #91)

This issue has been rescheduled for IETF 115

Text to be reviewed after issue #88 is closed

### Review of the Discovery Scenario Description #19

Jeff has provided a set of comments in github

- [ ] Italo: Review and proposed resolutions for the comments
