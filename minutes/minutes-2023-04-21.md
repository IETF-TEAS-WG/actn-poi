## Discussion (POI Pluggable)

Reviewed the additions to the pluggables draft (part of them) and here is the agreed plan:

-	Daniele will conclude the description of option 2 and workflows and then send the draft (doc format) to Gabriele
-	Gabriele will consolidate the changes and add the pictures for option 1 and 2
-	Weâ€™ll try to have everything done by the next meeting (Friday 28th) to finalize the review together.

We also discussed pros and cons of adding the models to the draft. The rough consensus is to keep the models in a separate document and leave this one to describe the architecture options and the workflow. Daniele will also check with the Routing AD to inputs. Usually, the IESG is not super happy to have too many architecture and informational drafts, but at the same time it is good to explain how to use the models we build.
