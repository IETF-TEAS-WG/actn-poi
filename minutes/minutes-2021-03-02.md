#### [Brent Presentation](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/6079483/inter-domain-examples.pptx)

Discussion about the need for EPE SID with simple inter-domain interconnection scenarios as in ACTN POI referene network: if there are cross-links at the domain boundaries, EPE SID is mandatory

Further investigation is needed to evaluate if EPE SID is needed in case there are no cross-links at the domain boundaries

__Action (Brent/Paolo):__ provide more input about the need to support EPE SID

Jeff B.: we need to consider two options: one where the MDSC has the full visibility and the other option where the MDSC request each PCE a list of candiate policies/paths in each domain and then the MDSC selects the best optimal end-to-end path
It will take time for operators to have SR everywhere so some hybrid scenario would still be required

Italo: there so many options (the list discussed today is not exhaustive) so better to focus one long-term option for E2E SR and one for the mid-term with co-existence of RSVP-TE and SR domains

Jeff B.: We need to support at least the seamless MPLS case and the E2E SR case. The cleanest way for end-to-end would be the E2R SR-TE

Brent: I agree with what has been said. We need to explore how the scenario will work with PCEs having partial visibility

There is a need for TI-LFA in each domain for local protection.
