# ACTN POI bi-weekly call (August 4, 2020)

## Participants

- Italo Busi
- Sergio Belotti
- Jeff Bouquier
- Jeff Tantsura
- Michael Scharf
- Paolo Volpato

## Review of the minutes of the last call (July 27. 2020)

Jeff B. reported that it is also possible that the TN NSSMF is implemented within the Orchestrator layer and have an interface toward the underlying MDSC which is in charge of both the connectivity service and the underlying transport layer.

The conclusions from July 27, 2020 are confirmed:
- besides CMI and MPI, MDSC could support other types of NBIs;
- these interfaces are usually operator-specific;
- in current network deployment, MDSC usually interacts with OSS/Orchestrator through these interfaces, rather than directly with the customer (via CMI);
- we can assume in the POI draft that the OSS/Orchestrator requests MDSC to setup L2VPN/L3VPN services through mechanisms which are outside the scope of the draft.

## Document re-structuring (new ToC)

No further progress on the document after the call on July 27, 2020.

Work plan:
- Italo/Sergio/Paolo to provide some text proposal for completing section 2 (target date is August 14)
- All to review the proposal for section 2 and provide feedbacks before the call on September 7

The latest draft is available on github: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/tree/new-toc
