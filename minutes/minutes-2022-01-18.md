## Discussion

### LAG (issue #5 and issue #74)

LAG was useful few years ago to expand capacity with 10G links but LAG is no longer an important feature with current high capacity interfaces (100G and above), so it could be removed

Swamy: how to increase capacity with 100G links?

Jeff: are you considering LAG for 100G interfaces?

- [ ] Jeff/Fabio: to check whether LAG is still a priority for high capacity interfaces (100G and above)

Victor: out of scope for this current version or out of scope of this document?

Agreement to keep LAG out of scope for this draft version (draft PR #69) and to add it in a later revision of the document before WG LC
