## Discussion

### Provisioning of LAG (issue #5)

Reviewed and discussed some of the open issues in PR #90

It is possible that within the same P-PNC domains LAG and non-LAG links co-exist: need to find a solution to allow the P-PNC know whether a Ethernet link that is discovered or configured by the MDSC is intended to support an IP Link or to be used within a LAG

Further investigation is needed about the need to support the configuration of the LAG after the IP link has been created without LAG since it is possible to create a LAG with only one member to be able to add new members in the future

- [ ] Jeff/Italo: To check about the requirement to support the configuration of the LAG after the IP link has been created without LAG
