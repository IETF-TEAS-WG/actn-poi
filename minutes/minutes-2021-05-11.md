### Draft expiring:

The draft has expired on May 6, 2021

1. Refresh the current draft with no changes other than the date and revision number
2. Upload the -02 draft as in current master branch (addressing Dhruv's comments) and plan for another -03 draft update for IETF 111
3. Let the draft expire and uplaod a -02 draft update for IETF 111

Proceed with option 2, addressing also [Issue #46](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/46)

After uploading -02, send a notification mail to TEAS WG requesting more review of the document to get more comments that could be addressed before IETF 111

### Use of kramdown

In previous meetings it has been proposed to use kramdown instead of Word as the tool to prepare the draft

An experiment has been done to see how the current draft would be in kramdown: [PR#48](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/pull/48)

The only drawback of kramdown is that the syntax is not documented so some experiments are needed (also searching from other kramdown drafts) 

The advantages are that the syntax is much lighter than XML and, like XML, being an ASCII file could be better integrated with github to track changes and proposed text changes (pull request)

### Plan for IETF 111

Daniel has volounteered to have a full review of the -03 draft before submitting it to IETF.

Possible plan for an update at IETF 111:
- All: prepare a -03 draft for IETF 110 before June 28
- Daniel: provide a review before July 5
- Italo: submit the -03 draft on July 12 (cut-off dealine for IETF 111)
