## Discussion

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

Draft mail for TEAS WG under preparation in: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/jDNp8VE9QC6r3wuLLjPDmA

Confirm agreement to propose option 3: the notes have been updated accordingly

> - [ ] All: review the proposed text of the draft mail for TEAS WG before Thursday May 26 EOB

- [ ] Italo: send the mail to TEAS WG (after review)

- [ ] Italo: Update the draft text based on the comment resolution

### Transparent Services over WDM (issue #36)

> - [x] Italo/Gabriele: further investigate and provide feedbacks

Agreement to describe the transparent services, noting that frame-based services are also possible but not analyses in the draft

- [ ] Italo: Update the draft to describe only the transparent services

### Update L3VPN figure (issue #82)

> - [x] Gabriele: please provide an ASCII art version of the figure

Proposal to be reviewed: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8604814/l3vpn-example.txt

Need to change inter-layer links as cross-layer links to align with the terminology used in the draft

The figure is hard to read because showing both links and paths on the same ASCII figure is quite hard: it has been suggested to split the figure into two figures, one showing the links and another one showing the paths

> - [ ] Gabriele: split the ASCII art figure into two figures, one showing the links and another one showing the paths

### Review of the Discovery Scenario Description (issue #19)

Jeff has started the review and has shared some early comments

It is possible to have in the same network a mix of WSON and Flexi-grid tunnels so they are not necessarily alternative
