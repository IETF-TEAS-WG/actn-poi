## Participants:

- Jeff Tantsura

## Review of the minutes of the last call (June 29. 2020)

No comments

IPR poll has been started by the TEAS WG chairs.

The WG adoption poll is expected to start after all the contributors/authors have replied to the IPR poll.

## Document re-structuring (new ToC)

The text changes proposed by Jeff B. have been reviewed. Some changes have been proposed (marked with revision bars)

Comments for further discussion:
    1) Does the Customer portal interacts with the BSS? From Figure 2 it seems it is interacting with the OSS/Orchestration layer
    2) which YANG models are used between OSS/Orchestration and MDSC? LxSM or LxNM? VN and TSM are still applicable?

Target is to have a stable version of sections 2.3 and 2.4 by the next call (July 20)
