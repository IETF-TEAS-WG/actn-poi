## Document re-structuring (new ToC)

Need to clarify the role of CNC : on top of MDSC should be OSS or orchestrator. 

The early sections should mention more explicitly that service provisioning / fulfillment is used in the I-D as one use case where the work-flow is triggered by a service request received from the OSS/orchestrator layer at theMDSC's North Bound Interface. There are other POI use cases beyond discovery, which are more "Operations driven" (e.g., optimization, troubleshooting, ...). Different to service fulfillment, the workflows then are not related at all to a service provisioning request received from the OSS/orchestration layer.

It makes sense to think at L2/L3 NM as NBI from MDSC, since what is needed is something related to to nework configuration from operator prospective. 

> Action (Jeff. B): Propose updates to section 2.2 based on this discussion

> Action (Italo/Sergio) Propose updates to section 2.3
