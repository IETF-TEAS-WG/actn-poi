## Discussion

Comments addressed and proposed resolution available on PR #69

### IETF 113 preparation (issue #75)

> - [ ] @oscargdd : have some offline discussion with SPRING people to start sharing the issue

> - [x] @italobusi @oscargdd @sergiobelotti : check with Pavan on TEAS Friday call

Pavan suggests to just send a mail to SPRING mailing list. The presentation slot would be worthwhile after there is a solution draft to discuss.

Waiting for further feedbacks from Oscar offline discussion.

### Text review (PR #69)

#### Figures for link discovery cases would help

> - [x] Gabriele: to prepare an ASCII version of slides 3, 5, 9 and, optinally, 7 for inclusion, as examples, in the draft

> - [x] Italo: update the draft description referencing the examples in the slides

Text updated in PR#69 to reference the figures in ppt slides

ASCII figures provided by Gabriele:

[ASCII-drawings-for-POI-v1.txt](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8161120/ASCII-drawings-for-POI-v1.txt)

ASCII figures updated during the call (editorial refinement):

[ASCII-drawings-for-POI-v2.txt](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8161143/ASCII-drawings-for-POI-v2.txt)

- [ ] Italo: finalize the ASCII figures and update the draft with the new figures

#### SR-TE bandwidth

> - [x] Brent: to provide some text for section 4.2.3 about the protection options: to be further discussed whether to place this text in section 4.2.3 or in section 2.2.2

A new open issue #80 has been created (target IETF 114)

#### LLDP: Chassis ID versus System Name TLVs

> - [x] Italo: update the text to clarify that:
>   - routers and optical NEs should report all the relevant LLDP information (including System Name is used)
>   - the encoding of the LLDP information is implementation-specific, but the encoding rules need to be consistent across all the PNCs. The suggestion is to encode the Chassis ID and Port ID since they are mandatory TLVs.

Latest text in PR #69 updated accordingly

#### Explicit path configuration

> - [x] Paolo: to discuss offline via mail some text proposal for section 2.2

Proposal submitted to github: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8122913/draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability.-.JB-PV-SB-new2.2.docx

Text proposal discussed offline and text in PR #69 updated accordingly

#### Who configures IP links: P-PNC, MDSC or either (on a case-by-case)

> - [x] Jeff: get some feedbacks from IP dept

> - [x] Continue discussion of this issue offline

Conclusion from offline discussion:
- Update the draft assuming that the intra-domain IP links are always configured by the P-PNC
- Describe the implications of this assumption:
  - MDSC receives a request to setup a L2/L3 VPN service
  - MDSC understands that in order to fulfill this service requests it needs to setup a new optical tunnel (to support the setup of a new IP link)
  - MDSC requests the O-PNC to setup the optical tunnel
  - After the optical tunnel has been successfully setup, MDSC waits for the P-PNC to configure the new IP link
     - After the new optical tunnel has been setup, the P-PNC may automatically discovers the new adjacency (e.g., through LLDP) and configures the new IP link.
     - Alternatively, the MDSC may configure the new intra-domain Ethernet link and the P-PNC can then configure the new IP link.
  - After the P-PNC has setup the new IP link, the MDSC requests the P-PNC to setup a new SR-TE path or re-route an existing SR-TE path through the new IP link
    - The MDSC will get notified that the new IP link has been setup by the P-PNC by a topology update of the SR-TE topology exposed by the P-PNC
- Discuss this issue during the TEAS WG session at IETF 113 to get feedbacks from the WG
- Track this as a new open issue (*TBD*) in github to be resolved by IETF 114, taking into account the feedbacks from IETF 113 discussion
- The configuration of the inter-domain IP links does not involve any multi-layer coordination and therefore can be considered outside the scope of this document

- [ ] Italo: Update the text to align with this conclusion

Open issue #81 has been created to track the discussion at IETF 113

#### Terminology: router port versus Ethernet interface

Summary of offline discussion:
- Use the term “port” to represent the physical entity and the term “interface” to entities which can be logical
- Describe the router configuration (if needed) as:
  - without LAG: : an Ethernet port (physical) supporting an Ethernet interface supporting an IP interface
  - with LAG: a set of Ethernet ports (physical) each one supporting an Ethernet interface and all supporting a LAG interface (logical) supporting an IP interface (logical)
- Describe the optical NE configuration (if needed) as:
  - an Ethernet port (physical) supporting an Ethernet interface
- A link is an association between two interfaces that can exchange traffic directly
  - An Ethernet link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces
  - An IP link is a link between two IP interfaces
- Define the following links:
  - a cross-layer (Ethernet) link is an Ethernet link between an Ethernet interface on the router and an Ethernet interface on the optical NE, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these router and optical NE;
  - an intra-domain single-layer Ethernet link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces on adjacent routers, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these adjacent routers
  - an intra-domain single-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces on adjacent routers, supported by an intra-domain single-layer Ethernet link
  - an inter-domain single-layer Ethernet link is an Ethernet link between two Ethernet interfaces on adjacent routers, which belong to different P-PNC domains, supported by a fiber (cable) between the corresponding Ethernet ports on these adjacent routers
  - an inter-domain single-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces on adjacent routers, which belong to different P-PNC domains, supported by an inter-domain single-layer Ethernet link
  - an intra-domain multi-layer ETH link is a link between two Ethernet interfaces supported by two cross-layer links and an optical tunnel
  - an intra-domain multi-layer IP link is a link between two IP interfaces, supported by an intra-domain multi-layer ETH link
- Consider the concept of a LAG link supported by multiple ETH links (to be discussed whether only intra-domain single-layer or also of other types when LAG scenarios are added to the draft)

- [ ] Italo: include these definitions in the draft

#### Additional comments

> - [x] Italo: Update the reference to L3NM draft with a reference to RFC9182

Latest text in PR #69 updated accordingly

> - [x] Italo: check with TEAS experts about L3-TE Topo for SR-TE

A new open issue #85 has been created (target IETF 114)

- [ ] Italo: update section 2.3 for consistency with section 2.2

- [ ] Italo: renumber section 4.1 and 4.2 as sections 4 and 5 (leaving room for some sub-sections)

- [ ] Italo: move around some text in section 4.2 to improve the flow of the description
