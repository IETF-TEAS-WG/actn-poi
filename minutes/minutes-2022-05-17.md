## Discussion

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

> - [x] Anton/Brent: provide further feedbacks about the applicability of the generalized procedure to other solutions (e.g., LSP stitching between two RSVP-TE domains)

Draft mail for TEAS WG under preparation in: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/jDNp8VE9QC6r3wuLLjPDmA

> - [ ] All: review the proposed text of the draft mail for TEAS WG

There was some support during the call for the text in option 3

Brent: we need to check that the text is generic enough to apply to both SR-MPLS and SRv6

- [ ] Brent: check that the current text description is applicable also to SRv6

### Transparent Services over WDM (issue #36)

Sergio: the transparent mapping is more common. Timing transparent is also important which can be supported with GMP mapping. No need to describe both options in the draft. The preference is to describe only the transparent case

Jeff: I think it makes sense since the frame-based requires additional hardware

- [ ] Italo/Gabriele: further investigate and provide feedbacks

### LAG (issue #74)

- [ ] Brent: check that it is possible to configure LLDP snooping on each member of the LAG

### SR-TE traffic steering on a device (issue #72)

> - [x] Oscar/Jeff : further investigate which model could be applied at the MPI

With EVPN it is possible to have a common mechanism, based on BGP, between L2VPN and L3VPN. The "preferred-path" option is only required for traditional L2VPN based on T-LDP.

Need to further investigate the information required at the MPI to drive this configuration.

- [ ] Italo: check offline with Oscar

An alternative approach could say that it is assumed that the L2VPN and L3VPN is properly configured to steer the traffic to a given policy by mechanisms which are outside the scope of this draft.
