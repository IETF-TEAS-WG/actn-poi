## Discussion

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

Slides describing two examples of a common procedure based on TE tunnel model reviewed and discussed: 
[multi-domain-path-options-00.pptx](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/8642311/multi-domain-path-options-00.pptx)

The SR-TE option is in line with the description in the current draft

Some implementation issues have been identified with the option based on LSP stitching between two RSVP-TE domains:
- the slide is assuming that the BR would be able to stitch between a static LSP segment and a dynamic LSP segment, but ths feature is not (widely) available on IP routers;
- an alternative approach could be to setup an RSVP-TE session (with an IGP instance) between the adjacent BRs, but this approach is not practical in real network deployments.

It has been agreed that the procedure described in the current draft cannot be generalized to cover the case where BGP-LU is used, which is the most common solution in today's networks

Further investigation is needed to conclude that the SR-TE procedure described in the draft can be generalized to other solutions (e.g., LSP stitching between two RSVP-TE domains)

- [ ] Anton/Brent: provide further feedbacks about the applicability of the generalized procedure to other solutions (e.g., LSP stitching between two RSVP-TE domains)

Draft mail for TEAS WG under preparation in: https://demo.hedgedoc.org/jDNp8VE9QC6r3wuLLjPDmA

The text requires further updates based on the investigation of the feasibility to generalize the common description of the SR-TE procedure

- [ ] All: review the proposed text of the draft mail for TEAS WG
