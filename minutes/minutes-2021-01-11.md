### Review of Github Open Issues

[Issue #2](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/2) and [Issue #3](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/3) have been closed with the text of the latest draft, which requires NMDA and JSON encoding: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability-01#section-3.1

### Review of the latest draft

Added [Issue #32](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/32): to track the need to evaluate at a later stage whether to address the setup inter-AS/inter area IP Links supported by Optical network in a future version of the draft or keep this out of scope.

Added [Issue #33](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/33) about network service terminology. Sergio and Jeff Bouquier volounteered to address it, checking also the definitions in RFC8309.

Added [Issue #34](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/34) to check with OPSAWG the applicability of L2NM and L3NM also the the interface between MDSC and the OSS/Orchestration layer.

Added [Issue #35](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/35) to align the TE Service Mapping description in section 2.1 and 2.2 with the latest version of draft-ietf-teas-te-service-mapping-yang.

Added [Issue #36](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/36) to discuss which service model to use (ietf-trans-client-service or ietf-eth-tran-service) to setup optical by-pass through a DWDM network (without OTN). The current text in section 3.2.2 seems a bit incosistent. Italo, Gabriele and Sergio volounteered to address it.

Added [Issue #37](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/37) to add some text describing that the optical impairements topology is out of scope since this draft is assuming that Optical path computation is performed by the O-PNCs. Daniel volounteered to propose some text.

Added [Issue #39](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/39) to describe the case where LLDP snooping is not supported: either static or proprietary solution.

Added [Issue #40](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/40) to describe LLDP snooping security considerations. Daniel volounteered to provide some description.

Added [Issue #41](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/41) to provide security considerations.

Added [Issue #42](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/42) to provide some short text for the operational considerations. Daniel volounteered to provide some text proposal.
