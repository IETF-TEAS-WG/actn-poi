### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

Brent has presented his slides: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38#issuecomment-818946509

Configure multiple loopbacks addresses in the target PE and ASBRs and advertise all of them with BGP and configure:
* a BGP policy to advertise an ASBR loopback for 
* static route on the source PE and ASBR to select the proper intra-domain TE tunnel

Jeff: I am not sure there is need for the static route configuration

Question about whether to focus on inter-domain SR-TE: operators would still like keeping seamless MPLS since migration to end-to-end SR-TE would take time

We can start analyzing the SR-TE scenario and add the seamless MPLS scenario later on

We can have a simple example with two PEs and two domains (as in ACTN POI reference scenario) and clarify in the text that more complex scenario should be addressed by a more complex logic to be implemented in the MDSC, balancing between the configuration complexity and the full control of the network behavior

- [ ] **Brent:** prepare additional slides providing an example targeted to the ACTN POI reference scenario.

We can clarify that there are multiple options to request O-PNC to perform optical path computation as described in the path computation draft. The local optical path computation can be done triggered by MDSC or upfront by optical-PNC by itself, providing new potential IP link (supported by optical path computed by O-PNC).

Agreement to analyse the partial summarization scenario in this draft. Other scenarios can be addressed in future documents, if needed.

## Next calls:

- April 20th at 10:30am CEST (Slot 1)
- April 27th at 5pm CEST (Slot 2)
- May 4th at 10:30am CEST (Slot 1)
- May 11th at 5pm CEST (Slot 2)

### Plan for IETF 111

Daniel has volounteer to have a full review of the -02 draft before submitting it to IETF.

Possible plan for an update at IETF 111:
- All: prepare a -02 draft for IETF 110 before June 28
- Daniel: provide a review before July 5
- Italo: submit the -02 draft on July 12 (cut-off dealine for IETF 111)
