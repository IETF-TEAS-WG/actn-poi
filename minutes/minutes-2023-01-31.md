## Discussion

### ACTN POI Next Steps

Discussion about whether to create a new repository or new repositories for the new POI draft(s) or re-use the current github repository

It has been noted that [RFC8874](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8874) suggests one github repository for each draft but there are existing cases where a single github repository has been used for multiple drafts

It has also been noted there is are no IETF github repositories for the TEAS WG drafts

Oscar mentioned that he is going to discuss with the other TEAS WG chairs the organization of github for TEAS WG

- [ ] Oscar: reports if there are any guidelines for the TEAS WG chairs on the github repository structure
