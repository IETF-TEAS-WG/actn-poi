## Discussion

### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

#### Local protection with TI-LFA ([Issue #56](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/56))

Brent has presented some slides analysing how TI-LFA can work with SRLGs:

https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/files/7204870/TI-LFA_TOI.1.0.pptx

It seems sufficient that the MDSC configures the P-PNC with the SRLGs of the multi-layer IP links.

It is worth noting that the list of SRLGs for a multi-layer IP link can be quite long. Implementation-specific mechanisms can be implemented by the MDSC or by the O-PNC to summarize the SRLGs of an Optical tunnel. These mechanisms have not impact on the YANG models nor on the interoperability at the MPI, but cares have to be taken to avoid missing information.

- [ ] **Italo**: update the draft text based on the analysis and request Brent and Jeff B. to review the text
