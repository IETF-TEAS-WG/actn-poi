## Discussion

### Feedbacks from IETF 114

Draft presented during TEAS WG session at IETF 114

Minutes: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/minutes-114-teas-202207251000/
Recording: https://play.conf.meetecho.com/Playout/?session=IETF114-TEAS-20220725-1400

Feedbacks from the chairs that the recommendation to follow a technology agnostic approach has not been completely followed: issue #88 has been reopened

No other feedbacks received

### Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88)

Given the feedbacks from IETF 115 discussion, a further analysis of the draft has been made and a follow-up mail has been sent to the TEAS WG chairs to further discuss this topic

Text changes to address the few issues identified during this analysis has been proposed in draft PR #101

Jeff: in the gap analysis we are highlighting some missing attributes for SR-TE. Being just technology-agnostic would not help providing a complete gap analysis.

- [ ] **Italo**: invite the TEAS WG chairs to join the slot 2 call on October 4th to address their comments

### Review of the Discovery Scenario Description (Draft PR #92)

Comments resolution discussed offline with Jeff and provided in draft PR #92 and ported to draft PR #101

Jeff has checked that all the comments and proposed resolutions have been properly moved to draft PR #101

Draft PR #92 has been closed without being merged because superseded by PR #101

### Plan for IETF 115

The plan for IETF 115 (shared during IETF 114) was:
- update discovery scenario
- describe transparent optical services instead of Ethernet frame-based services
- complete description of multi-layer SRLG
- terminology clean-up

The open issues in github has been split into three groups (milestones):
* September 2022: issues to be addressed offline before re-starting weekly calls (see Draft PR #101)
* IETF 115: issues to be addressed before IETF 115
* WG LC: issues to be addressed before requesting WG LC

PR #101 proposes updates to the I-D for review by the group:
* L3VPN Figure and text aligned to reference two figures instead of only one: issue #82 (discussed offline with Gabriele)
* Addressing review comments as discussed in Draft PR #92 (discussed offline with Jeff)
* Added Oscar as contributor (see issue #99)
* Added text about multiple parallel TE paths (comment from Jeff pending resolution in Draft PR #92)
* Addressing some pending issues with generalizing SR-TE description (see latest comments to issue #88)

Issues planned but not yet addressed:
* Check the need for L3-TE Topo (issue #85)
* P-PNC awareness of underlying Optical tunnels' SRLGs (issue #45)
* Transparent Services over WDM (issue #36)

The deadline for IETF 115 I-D submission is October 24, 2022

Agreed to move the following issues to the IETF 115 milestones:
* P-PNC awareness of underlying Optical tunnels' SRLGs (issue #45)
* Transparent Services over WDM (issue #36)
* Generalize description of SR-TE tunnel (issue #88) which depends on further discussion with TEAS WG chairs

### Add detailed examples (issue #102)

See: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2022-07-05.md

> Oscar: would be useful to add examples for API calls/workflows (e.g., JSON code)
> 
> The examples are quite useful but would make the document even bigger (see for example the TNBI document developed at CCAMP WG): it may be worthwhile raising the question at the TEAS WG during IETF 114

The issue has been presented during the TEAS WG session in IETF 114 but no feedbacks received

- [ ] **Italo**: send a mail to the TEAS WG mailing list asking for feedbacks

### Check with SPRING the use of TE tunnel for SR-TE (issue #87)

- [ ] **Oscar**: share some slides describing the differences between the TE tunnel model and the SR-TE policies model
