### Closed Issues

### Next calls

Need to swap slot 1 and slot 2 calls to avoid some overlapping with other bi-weekly calls

## Discussion

### Kramdown (Draft PR #48)

The team working on MW topology draft within CCAMP WG is planning to move the work on github using kramdown

There are some tools that can be set to integrate kramdown with github and IETF datatracker

Tutorial planned on December 16th at 1-2pm CET:

https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/ccamp/Fykrfzot7HMjZmDxJSgqoWS2D40/

The session is open to anybody who is interested

### UNI topology (issue #31)

The P-PNC does not necessarily know whether an inter-domain link is an access link (between a PE and a CE), an inter-domain IP link (between two BRs) or a cross-layer link (between an IP router and an optical NE). This information can be discovered by the MDSC.

### Optical impairments topology (issue #37)

The issue will be closed when PR #69 is merged

### Comments from Victor/Oscar (PR #70)

Do not merge the PR but incorporate the proposed changes in draft PR#69

Agreed to use the term "approach" for describing the three cases of path computation


### Proposed text review (Draft PR #69)

Clarify what level of abstraction is assumed

Move to section 4 the description of how the topology models are used to discover optical and IP topologies

Add some description and figure on how inter-domain links are discovered

Add some description about the case of intra-domain single-layer IP links (with no undelay optical tunnel)
