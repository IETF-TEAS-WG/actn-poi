## Discussion

### ACTN POI Next Steps

Review items for further study from [minutes-2023-01-10.md](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/blob/master/minutes/minutes-2023-01-10.md)

> 1. Colored interfaces on IP routers
> 2. Multi-layer fault management
> 3. Multi-layer performance management
> 4. Multi-layer resiliency (see Appendix B in current draft)
> 5. Setup of an optical tunnel for inter-domain IP links
> 6. Not congruent domain boundaries between IP and Optical domains
> 7. Mix of fixed and flexi-grid DWDM networks
> 8. Muxponder scenarios
> 9. Multi-layer/multi-domain optimizations and/or maintenance activities
> 10. Other approaches for multi-layer path computation (Full summarization and Full knowledge: section 2.1.2)
> 
> Conclusion: address points 1, 2, 3 and 4 (the analysis of scenarios 2, 3 and 4 at the MPI would be different between the transponder/muxponder use cases and the colored interfaces use cases). To further discussion the structure of the next draft(s): how many drafts and which content for each draft

It is possible to split into two drafts:
* one draft addressing item 1, covering almost the same use cases of the current draft when the transponders are on the routers instead of on the ROADM
* another draft addressing items 2, 3 and 4 for both the cases where the transponders are on the routers (pluggable) or on the ROADM (integrated)

It is not fully clear how much commonalities there are for items 2, 3 and 4 in these two cases (integrated or pluggable).

We will start addressing both cases in a single draft and assess at a later stage whether it is worthwhile keeping everything in a single draft or to split into two drafts.

Proposed names for the two new drafts:
- draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable
- draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance

> - [x] Oscar: reports if there are any guidelines for the TEAS WG chairs on the github repository structure

Oscar reported that a new github organization for the TEAS WG so the different individual github repositories can be moved there

The policy, like in other WGs, is to have a repository for each draft. This policy might be relaxed for the existing repositories which are covering more than one draft since it is not easy to split

We can start the work creating two new individual repositories

- [ ] Gabriele: start a new repository for draft-poidt-ccamp-actn-poi-pluggable 
- [ ] Italo: start a new repository for draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance

These individual repositories will then migrated in the WG organization once adopted

The plan is to start from an existing repository which provides automatic tool for uploading the I-D directly from github: Oscar will help us on setting up these two repositories during the next call (February 21st)
