### IETF 111 Status Upddate

Status of the work presented by Daniel. No comments from the floor.

The suggestion is to limit the number of analysed use cases to avoid issues with IESG later in the process. If additional use cases are considered useful, they could be addressed in new documents.

### Closed Issues

None

## Discussion

### L3VPN ([Issue #38](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/38))

Plan:
- consider summarization scenario
- consider BGP-LU option

- [ ] Need to discuss whether the BGP-LU option should be considered in the scope or out of scope for this document: ([Issue #66](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/66))

### Summarization

#### Summarization of IP topology ([Issue #64](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/64))

See: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/64#issuecomment-909082213

#### P-PNC awareness of underlaying Optical tunnels' SRLGs ([Issue #45](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/45))

There are scenarios where the SRLG information is needed: https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/45#issuecomment-896992292

- [ ] **Italo**: Review the current text and see if anything is missing about the Optical tunnels' SRLG information to be provided to P-PNCs

#### Hierarchical MSDC architecture ([Issue #46](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/46))

Previous text has been lost in -03 revision. Proposal to bring ti back with some additional details in [PR #65](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/65)

This text should be sufficient for the scope of this draft

- [ ] **Jeff B.**: review [PR #65](https://github.com/FabioPeruzzini/actn-poi/issues/65)
