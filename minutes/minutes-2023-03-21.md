## Discussion (POI Applicability)

### Add detailed examples #102

Agreed not to add API calls/workflow to the document and therefore to close issue #102 with no actions

Note: Oscar has confirmed offline he is ok with this

### Optical Transparent Service (issue #36)

If possible, we will generalize the description.

### SRLG Value does not provide risk info (issue #45)

How to associate risk level with an SRLG? We will need to discuss with TE authors. 

We will add some text that highlights this is a possible gap and should be investigated further in another document, or discussion.
