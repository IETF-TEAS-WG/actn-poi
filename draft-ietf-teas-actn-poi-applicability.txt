      Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered
            Networks (ACTN) to Packet Optical Integration (POI)


                 draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability-04


Abstract

   This document considers the applicability of Abstraction and Control
   of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet Optical Integration
   (POI)in the context of IP/MPLS and Optical internetworking. It
   identifies the YANG data models being defined by the IETF to support
   this deployment architecture and specific scenarios relevant for
   Service Providers.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) scenario with a specific focus on
   the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to Provisioning Network
   Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.

1. Introduction

   The complete automation of the management and control of Service
   Providers transport networks (IP/MPLS, optical, and microwave
   transport networks) is vital for meeting emerging demand for high-
   bandwidth use cases, including 5G and fiber connectivity services.
   The Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture and
   interfaces facilitate the automation and operation of complex
   Optical and IP/MPLS networks through standard interfaces and data
   models. Thus allowing a wide range of transport connectivity
   services that can be requested by the upper layers fulfilling almost
   any kind of service level requirements from a network perspective
   (e.g. physical diversity, latency, bandwidth, topology, etc.)

   Packet Optical Integration (POI) is an advanced use case of traffic
   engineering. In wide-area networks, a packet network based on the
   Internet Protocol (IP), and often Multiprotocol Label Switching
   (MPLS), is typically realized on top of an optical transport network
   that uses Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)(and
   optionally an Optical Transport Network (OTN)layer).

   In many existing network deployments, the packet and the optical
   networks are engineered and operated independently. As a result,
   there are technical differences between the technologies (e.g.,
   routers compared to optical switches) and the corresponding network
   engineering and planning methods (e.g., inter-domain peering
   optimization in IP, versus dealing with physical impairments in
   DWDM, or very different time scales). In addition, customers needs

   can be different between a packet and an optical network, and it is
   not uncommon to use different vendors in both domains. The operation
   of these complex packet and optical networks is often siloed, as
   these technology domains require specific skills sets.

   The packet/optical network deployment and operation separation are
   inefficient for many reasons. Both capital expenditure (CAPEX) and
   operational expenditure (OPEX) could be significantly reduced by
   integrating the packet and the optical network. Multi-layer online
   topology insight can speed up troubleshooting (e.g., alarm
   correlation) and network operation (e.g., coordination of
   maintenance events), multi-layer offline topology inventory can
   improve service quality (e.g., detection of diversity constraint
   violations) and multi-layer traffic engineering can use the
   available network capacity more efficiently (e.g., coordination of
   restoration). In addition, provisioning workflows can be simplified
   or automated as needed across layers (e.g., to achieve bandwidth-on-
   demand or to perform maintenance events).

   ACTN framework enables this complete multi-layer and multi-vendor
   integration of packet and optical networks through MDSC and packet
   and optical PNCs.

   In this document, critical scenarios for POI are described from the
   packet service layer perspective and identify the required
   coordination between packet and optical layers to improve POI
   deployment and operation. Precise definitions of scenarios can help
   with achieving a common understanding across different disciplines.
   The focus of the scenarios are IP/MPLS networks operated as a client
   of optical DWDM networks. The scenarios are ordered by increasing
   the level of integration and complexity. For each multi-layer
   scenario, the document analyzes how to use the interfaces and data
   models of the ACTN architecture.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps
   will help assess the feasibility of integration between IP and
   Optical DWDM domain (and optionally OTN layer) in an end-to-end
   multi-vendor service provisioning perspective.

2. Reference architecture and network scenario

   This document analyses several deployment scenarios for Packet and
   Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is deployed to
   control a multi-layer and multi-domain network, with two Optical
   domains and two Packet domains, as shown in Figure 1:

                       Figure 1 - Reference Scenario

   The ACTN architecture, defined in [RFC8453], is used to control this
   multi-domain network where each Packet PNC (P-PNC) is responsible
   for controlling its IP domain, which can be either an Autonomous
   System (AS), [RFC1930], or an IGP area within the same operator
   network. Each Optical PNC (O-PNC) in the above topology is
   responsible for controlling its Optical Domain.

   The routers between IP domains can be either AS Boundary Routers
   (ASBR) or Area Border Router (ABR): in this document, the generic
   term Border Router (BR) is used to represent either an ASBR or a
   ABR.

   The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain
   multi-layer (Packet and Optical) network. A specific standard

   interface (MPI) permits MDSC to interact with the different
   Provisioning Network Controller (O/P-PNCs).

   The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to MDSC hiding
   technology-specific aspects of the network and hiding topology
   details depending on the policy chosen regarding the level of
   abstraction supported. The level of abstraction can be obtained
   based on P-PNC and O-PNC configuration parameters (e.g. provide the
   potential connectivity between any PE and any BR in an MPLS-TE
   network).

   In the network scenario of Figure 1, it is assumed that:

   o  The domain boundaries between the IP and Optical domains are
      congruent. In other words, one Optical domain supports
      connectivity between Routers in one and only one Packet Domain;

   o  Inter-domain links exist only between Packet domains (i.e.,
      between BR routers) and between Packet and Optical domains (i.e.,
      between routers and Optical NEs). In other words, there are no
      inter-domain links between Optical domains;

   o  The interfaces between the Routers and the Optical NEs are
      "Ethernet" physical interfaces;

   o  The interfaces between the Border Routers (BRs) are "Ethernet"
      physical interfaces.

   This version of the document assumes that the IP link supported by
   the Optical network are always intra-AS (PE-BR, intra-domain BR-BR,
   PE-P, BR-P, or P-P) and that the BRs are co-located and connected by
   an IP link supported by an Ethernet physical link.

   The possibility to setup inter-AS/inter-area IP links (e.g.,
   inter-domain BR-BR or PE-PE), supported by optical network, is for
   further study.

   Therefore, if inter-domain links between the Optical domains exist,
   they would be used to support multi-domain Optical services, which
   are outside the scope of this document.

   The Optical NEs within the optical domains can be ROADMs or OTN
   switches, with or without a ROADM.

   The MDSC in Figure 1 is responsible for multi-domain and multi-layer
   coordination across multiple Packet and Optical domains, as well as
   to provide L2/L3VPN services.

   Although the new optical technologies (e.g. QSFP-DD ZR 400G)
   providing DWDM pluggable interfaces on the Routers, the deployment
   of those pluggable optics is not yet widely adopted by the
   operators. The reason is that most operators are not yet ready to
   manage Packet and Transport networks in a single unified domain. As
   a consequence, this draft is not addressing the unified scenario.
   Instead, the unified use case will be described in a different
   draft.

   From an implementation perspective, the functions associated with
   MDSC and described in [RFC8453] may be grouped in different ways.

   1. Both the service- and network-related functions are collapsed into
     a single, monolithic implementation, dealing with the end customer
     service requests received from the CMI (Customer MDSC Interface)
     and adapting the relevant network models. An example is
     represented in Figure 2 of [RFC8453]
   2. An implementation can choose to split the service-related and the
     network-related functions into different functional entities, as
     described in [RFC8309] and in section 4.2 of [RFC8453]. In this
     case, MDSC is decomposed into a top-level Service Orchestrator,
     interfacing the customer via the CMI, and into a Network
     Orchestrator interfacing at the southbound with the PNCs. The
     interface between the Service Orchestrator and the Network
     Orchestrator is not specified in [RFC8453].
   3. Another implementation can choose to split the MDSC functions
     between an "higher-level MDSC" (MDSC-H) responsible for
     packet-optical multi-layer coordination, interfacing with one
     Optical "lower-level MDSC" (MDSC-L), providing multi-domain
     coordination between the O-PNCs and one Packet MDSC-L, providing
     multi-domain coordination between the P-PNCs (see for example
     Figure 9 of [RFC8453]).
   4. Another implementation can also choose to combine the MDSC and the
     P-PNC functions together.

   Please note that in the current service provider's network
   deployments, at the North Bound of the MDSC, instead of a CNC,
   typically there is an OSS/Orchestration layer. In this case, the
   MDSC would implement only the Network Orchestration functions, as in
   [RFC8309] and described in point 2 above. In this case, the MDSC is
   dealing with the network services requests received from the
   OSS/Orchestration layer.

   [Editors'note:] Check for a better term to define the network
   services. It may be worthwhile defining what are the customer and
   network services.

   The OSS/Orchestration layer is a vital part of the architecture
   framework for a service provider:

   o  to abstract (through MDSC and PNCs) the underlying transport
      network complexity to the Business Systems Support layer;

   o  to coordinate NFV, Transport (e.g. IP, Optical and Microwave
      networks), Fixed Acess, Core and Radio domains enabling full
      automation of end-to-end services to the end customers;

   o  to enable catalogue-driven service provisioning from external
      applications (e.g. Customer Portal for Enterprise Business
      services), orchestrating the design and lifecycle management of
      these end-to-end transport connectivity services, consuming IP
      and/or Optical transport connectivity services upon request.

   The functionality of the OSS/Orchestration layer and the interface
   toward the MDSC are usually operator-specific and outside the scope
   of this draft. For example, this document assumes that the
   OSS/Orchestrator requests MDSC to set up L2VPN/L3VPN services
   through mechanisms that are outside the scope of this document.

   There are two prominent cases when MDSC coordination of underlying
   PNCs for POI networking is initiated:

   o  Initiated by a request from the OSS/Orchestration layer to setup
      L2VPN/L3VPN services that requires multi-layer/multi-domain
      coordination;

   o  Initiated by the MDSC itself to perform multi-layer/multi-domain
      optimizations and/or maintenance activities (e.g. rerouting LSPs
      with their associated services when putting a resource, like a
      fibre, in maintenance mode during a maintenance window).
      Unlike service fulfillment, these workflows are not related to a
      service provisioning request being received from
      the OSS/Orchestration layer.

   The two aforemetioned MDSC workflow cases are in the scope of this
   draft. The workflow initiation is transparent at the MPI.

2.1. L2/L3VPN Service Request North Bound of MDSC

   As explained in section 2, the OSS/Orchestration layer can request
   the MDSC to setup L2/L3VPN services (with or without TE
   requirements).

   Although the OSS/Orchestration layer interface is usually operator-
   specific, typically it would be using a RESTCONF/YANG interface with
   a more abstracted version of the MPI YANG data models used for
   network configuration (e.g. L3NM, L2NM).

   Figure 2 shows an example of possible control flow between the
   OSS/Orchestration layer and the MDSC to instantiate L2/L3VPN
   services, using the YANG models under the definition in [VN],
   [L2NM], [L3NM] and [TSM].

   o  The VN YANG model [VN], whose primary focus is the CMI, can also
      provide VN Service configuration from an orchestrated
      connectivity service point of view when the L2/L3VPN service has
      TE requirements. However, this model is not used to setup
      L2/L3VPN service with no TE requirements.

       o It provides the profile of VN in terms of VN members, each of
          which corresponds to an edge-to-edge link between customer
          end-points (VNAPs). It also provides the mappings between the
          VNAPs with the LTPs and the connectivity matrix with the VN
          member. The associated traffic matrix (e.g., bandwidth,
          latency, protection level, etc.) of VN member is expressed
          (i.e., via the TE-topology's connectivity matrix).

       o The model also provides VN-level preference information
          (e.g., VN member diversity) and VN-level admin-status and
          operational-status.

   o  The L2NM YANG model [L2NM], whose primary focus is the MPI, can
      also be used to provide L2VPN service configuration and site
      information, from a orchestrated connectivity service point of
      view.

   o  The L3NM YANG model [L3NM], whose primary focus is the MPI, can
      also be used to provide all L3VPN service configuration and site
      information, from a orchestrated connectivity service point of
      view.

   o  The TE & Service Mapping YANG model [TSM] provides TE-service
      mapping as well as site mapping.

       o TE-service mapping provides the mapping between a L2/L3VPN
          instance and the corresponding VN instances.

       o The TE-service mapping also provides the service mapping
          requirement type as to how each L2/L3VPN/VN instance is
          created concerning the underlay TE tunnels (e.g., whether
          they require a new and isolated set of TE underlay tunnels or
          not). See Section 2.2 for a detailed discussion on the
          mapping requirement types.

       o Site mapping provides the site reference information across
          L2/L3VPN Site ID, VN Access Point ID, and the LTP of the
          access link.

2.2. Service and Network Orchestration

   From a functional standpoint, MDSC represented in Figure 2
   interfaces with the OSS/Orchestration layer and decoupled L2/L3VPN
   service configuration functions from network configuration
   functions. Therefore in this document, the MDSC performs the
   functions of the Network Orchestrator, as defined in [RFC8309].

   One of the important MDSC functions is to identify which TE Tunnels
   should carry the L2/L3VPN traffic (e.g., from TE & Service Mapping
   configuration) and to relay this information to the P-PNCs, to
   ensure the PEs' forwarding tables (e.g., VRF) are properly
   populated, according to the TE binding requirement for the L2/L3VPN.

   TE binding requirement types [TSM] are:

   1. Hard Isolation with deterministic latency: The L2/L3VPN service
      requires a set of dedicated TE Tunnels providing deterministic
      latency performances and that cannot be not shared with other
      services, nor compete for bandwidth with other Tunnels.

   2. Hard Isolation: This is similar to the above case without
      deterministic latency requirements.

   3. Soft Isolation: The L2/L3VPN service requires a set of dedicated
      MPLS-TE tunnels that cannot be shared with other services, but
      which could compete for bandwidth with other Tunnels.

   4. Sharing: The L2/L3VPN service allows sharing the MPLS-TE Tunnels
      supporting it with other services.

   There could be additional TE binding requirements for the first
   three types with respect to different VN members of the same VN (on
   how different VN members, belonging to the same VN, can share or not
   network resources). For the first two cases, VN members can be
   hard-isolated, soft-isolated, or shared. For the third case, VN
   members can be soft-isolated or shared.

   In order to fulfil the L2/L3VPN end-to-end TE requirements,
   including the TE binding requirements, the MDSC needs to perform
   multi-layer/multi-domain path computation to select the BRs, the
   intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels and the intra-domain Optical Tunnels.

   Depending on the knowledge that MDSC has of the topology and
   configuration of the underlying network domains, three models for
   performing path computation are possible:

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                    January 2022


   1. Summarization: MDSC has an abstracted TE topology view of all of
      the underlying domains, both packet and optical. MDSC does not
      have enough TE topology information to perform
      multi-layer/multi-domain path computation. Therefore MDSC
      delegates the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to perform a local path
      computation within their controlled domains and it uses the
      information returned by the P-PNCs and O-PNCs to compute the
      optimal multi-domain/multi-layer path.
      This model presents an issue to P-PNC, which does not have the
      capability of performing a single-domain/multi-layer path
      computation (that is, P-PNC does not have any possibility to
      retrieve the topology/configuration information from the Optical
      controller). A possible solution could be to include a CNC
      function in the P-PNC to request the MDSC multi-domain Optical
      path computation, as shown in Figure 10 of [RFC8453].
      Another possible solution could be to rely on the MDSC recursive
      hierarchy, as defined in section 4.1 of [RFC8453], where, for
      each IP and Optical domain pair, a "lower-level MDSC" (MDSC-L)
      provides the essential multi-layer correlation and the "higher-
      level MDSC" (MDSC-H) provides the multi-domain coordination.
      In this case, the MDSC-H can get an abstact view of the
      underlying multi-layer domain topologies from its underlying
      MDSC-L. Each MDSC-L gets the full view of the IP domain topology
      from P-PNC and can get an abstracted view of the optical domain
      topology from its underlying O-PNC. In other words, topology
      abstraction is possible at the MPIs between MDSC-L and O-PNC and
      between MDSC-L and MDSC-H.

   2. Partial summarization: MDSC has full visibility of the TE
      topology of the packet network domains and an abstracted view of
      the TE topology of the optical network domains.
      MDSC then has only the capability of performing multi-
      domain/single-layer path computation for the packet layer (the
      path can be computed optimally for the two packet domains).
      Therefore MDSC still needs to delegate the O-PNCs to perform
      local path computation within their respective domains and it
      uses the information received by the O-PNCs, together with its TE
      topology view of the multi-domain packet layer, to perform
      multi-layer/multi-domain path computation.
      The role of P-PNC is minimized, i.e. is limited to management.

   3. Full knowledge: MDSC has the complete and enough detailed view of
      the TE topology of all the network domains (both optical and
      packet). In such case MDSC has all the information needed to
      perform multi-domain/multi-layer path computation, without
      relying on PNCs.

      This model may present, as a potential drawback, scalability
      issues and, as discussed in section 2.2. of [PATH-COMPUTE],
      performing path computation for optical networks in the MDSC is
      quite challenging because the optimal paths depend also on
      vendor-specific optical attributes (which may be different in the
      two domains if they are provided by different vendors).

   The current version of this draft assumes that MDSC supports at
   least model #2 (Partial summarization).

   [Note: check with opeerators for some references on real deployment]

2.2.1. Hard Isolation

   For example, when "Hard Isolation with, or without, deterministic
   latency" TE binding requirement is applied for a L2/L3VPN, new
   Optical Tunnels need to be setup to support dedicated IP links
   between PEs and BRs.

   The MDSC needs to identify the set of IP/MPLS domains and their BRs.
   This requires the MDSC to request each O-PNC to compute the
   intra-domain optical paths between each PEs/BRs pairs.

   When requesting optical path computation to the O-PNC, the MDSC
   needs to take into account the inter-layer peering points, such as
   the interconnections between the PE/BR nodes and the edge Optical
   nodes (e.g., using the inter-layer lock or the transitional link
   information, defined in [RFC8795]).

   When the optimal multi-layer/multi-domain path has been computed,
   the MDSC requests each O-PNC to setup the selected Optical Tunnels
   and P-PNC to setup the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels, over the
   selected Optical Tunnels. MDSC also properly configures its BGP
   speakers and PE/BR forwarding tables to ensure that the VPN traffic
   is properly forwarded.

2.2.2. Shared Tunnel Selection

   In case of shared tunnel selection, the MDSC needs to check if there
   is a multi-domain path which can support the L2/L3VPN end-to-end TE



Peruzzini et al.        Expires July 17, 2022                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                    January 2022


   service requirements (e.g., bandwidth, latency, etc.) using existing
   intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnels.

   If such a path is found, the MDSC selects the optimal path from the
   candidate pool and request each P-PNC to setup the L2/L3VPN service
   using the selected intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnel, between PE/BR nodes.

   Otherwise, the MDSC should detect if the multi-domain path can be
   setup using existing intra-domain MPLS-TE tunnels with modifications
   (e.g., increasing the tunnel bandwidth) or setting up new intra-
   domain MPLS-TE tunnel(s).

   The modification of an existing MPLS-TE Tunnel and the setup of a
   new MPLS-TE Tunnel may also require multi-layer coordination e.g.,
   in case the available bandwidth of underlying Optical Tunnels is not
   sufficient. Based on multi-domain/multi-layer path computation, the
   MDSC can decide for example to modify the bandwidth of an existing
   Optical Tunnel (e.g., ODUflex bandwidth increase) or to setup new
   Optical Tunnels to be used as additional LAG members of an existing
   IP link or as new IP links to re-route the MPLS-TE Tunnel.

   In all the cases, the labels used by the end-to-end tunnel are
   distributed in the PE and BR nodes by BGP. The MDSC is responsible
   to configure the BGP speakers in each P-PNC, if needed.

2.3. IP/MPLS Domain Controller and NE Functions

   IP/MPLS networks are assumed to have multiple domains. Each domain,
   corresponding to either an IGP area or an Autonomous System (AS)
   within the same operator network, is controlled by an IP/MPLS domain
   controller (P-PNC).

   Among the functions of the P-PNC, there are the setup or
   modification of the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels, between PEs and
   BRs, and the configuration of the VPN services, such as the VRF in
   the PE nodes, as shown in Figure 3:

             Figure 3 IP/MPLS Domain Controller & NE Functions

   It is assumed that BGP is running in the inter-domain IP/MPLS
   networks for L2/L3VPN. The P-PNC controller is also responsible for
   configuring the BGP speakers within its control domain, if
   necessary.

   The BGP would be responsible for the end-to-end tunnel label
   distribution on PE and BR nodes. The MDSC is responsible for
   selecting the BRs and the intra-domain MPLS-TE Tunnels between PE/BR
   nodes.

   If new MPLS-TE Tunnels are needed or modifications (e.g., bandwidth
   increase) to existing MPLS_TE Tunnels are needed, as outlined in
   section 2.2, the MDSC would request their setup or modifications to
   the P-PNCs (step 1 in Figure 3). Then the MDSC would request the
   P-PNC to configure the VPN, including selecting the intra-domain TE
   Tunnel (step 2 in Figure 3).

   The P-PNC should configure, using mechanisms outside the scope of
   this document, the ingress PE forwarding table, e.g., the VRF, to
   forward the VPN traffic, received from the CE, with the following
   three labels:

   o  VPN label: assigned by the egress PE and distributed by BGP;





Peruzzini et al.        Expires July 17, 2022                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                    January 2022


   o  end-to-end LSP label: assigned by the egress BR, selected by the
      MDSC, and distributed by BGP;

   o  MPLS-TE tunnel label, assigned by the next hop P node of the
      tunnel selected by the MDSC and distributed by mechanism internal
      to the IP/MPLS domain (e.g., RSVP-TE).

2.4. Optical Domain Controller and NE Functions

   The optical network provides the underlay connectivity services to
   IP/MPLS networks. The coordination of Packet/Optical multi-layer is
   done by the MDSC, as shown in Figure 1.

   The O-PNC is responsible to:

   o  provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology view of its
      underlying optical network resources;

   o  perform single-domain local path computation, when requested by
      the MDSC;

   o  perform Optical Tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC.

   The mechanisms used by O-PNC to perform intra-domain topology
   discovery and path setup are usually vendor-specific and outside the
   scope of this document.

   Depending on the type of optical network, TE topology abstraction,
   path computation and path setup can be single-layer (either OTN or
   WDM) or multi-layer OTN/WDM. In the latter case, the multi-layer
   coordination between the OTN and WDM layers is performed by the
   O-PNC.

3. Interface protocols and YANG data models for the MPIs

   This section describes general assumptions applicable at all the MPI
   interfaces, between each PNC (Optical or Packet) and the MDSC, and
   all the scenarios discussed in this document.

3.1. RESTCONF protocol at the MPIs

   The RESTCONF protocol, as defined in [RFC8040], using the JSON
   representation defined in [RFC7951], is assumed to be used at these
   interfaces. In addition, extensions to RESTCONF, as defined in
   [RFC8527], to be compliant with Network Management Datastore




Peruzzini et al.        Expires July 17, 2022                 [Page 16]

   Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342], are assumed to be used as
   well at these MPI interfaces and also at CMI interfaces.

3.2. YANG data models at the MPIs

   The data models used on these interfaces are assumed to use the YANG
   1.1 Data Modeling Language, as defined in [RFC7950].

3.2.1. Common YANG data models at the MPIs

   As required in [RFC8040], the "ietf-yang-library" YANG module
   defined in [RFC8525] is used to allow the MDSC to discover the set
   of YANG modules supported by each PNC at its MPI.

   Both Optical and Packet PNCs use the following common topology YANG
   models at the MPI to report their abstract topologies:

   o  The Base Network Model, defined in the "ietf-network" YANG module
      of [RFC8345];

   o  The Base Network Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-network-
      topology" YANG module of [RFC8345], which augments the Base
      Network Model;

   o  The TE Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-te-topology" YANG
      module of [RFC8795], which augments the Base Network Topology
      Model with TE specific information.

   These common YANG models are generic and augmented by technology-
   specific YANG modules as described in the following sections.

   Both Optical and Packet PNCs must use the following common
   notifications YANG models at the MPI so that any network changes can
   be reported almost in real-time to MDSC by the PNCs:

   o  Dynamic Subscription to YANG Events and Datastores over RESTCONF
      as defined in [RFC8650];

   o  Subscription to YANG Notifications for Datastores updates as
      defined in [RFC8641].

   PNCs and MDSCs must be compliant with subscription requirements as
   stated in [RFC7923].

3.2.2. YANG models at the Optical MPIs

   The Optical PNC also uses at least the following technology-specific
   topology YANG models, providing WDM and Ethernet technology-specific
   augmentations of the generic TE Topology Model:

   o  The WSON Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-wson-topology" YANG
      modules of [RFC9094], or the Flexi-grid Topology Model, defined
      in the "ietf-flexi-grid-topology" YANG module of [Flexi-TOPO];

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the OTN Topology Model,
      as defined in the "ietf-otn-topology" YANG module of [OTN-TOPO];

   o  The Ethernet Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-te-
      topology" YANG module of [CLIENT-TOPO];

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the network data model
      for L1 OTN services (e.g. an Ethernet transparent service) as
      defined in "ietf-trans-client-service" YANG module of draft-ietf-
      ccamp-client-signal-yang [CLIENT-SIGNAL];

   o  The WSON Topology Model or, alternatively, the Flexi-grid
      Topology model is used to report the DWDM network topology (e.g.,
      ROADMs and links) depending on whether the DWDM optical network
      is based on fixed grid or flexible-grid.

   The Ethernet Topology is used to report the cross-layer links
   between the IP routers and the edge ROADMs.

   The optical PNC uses at least the following YANG models:

   o  The TE Tunnel Model, defined in the "ietf-te" YANG module of
      [TE-TUNNEL];

   o  The WSON Tunnel Model, defined in the "ietf-wson-tunnel" YANG
      modules of [WSON-TUNNEL], or the Flexi-grid Media Channel Model,
      defined in the "ietf-flexi-grid-media-channel" YANG module of
      [Flexi-TUNNEL];

   o  Optionally, when the OTN layer is used, the OTN Tunnel Model,
      defined in the "ietf-otn-tunnel" YANG module of [OTN-TUNNEL];

   o  The Ethernet Client Signal Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-tran-
      service" YANG module of [CLIENT-SIGNAL].

   The TE Tunnel model is generic and augmented by technology-specific
   models such as the WSON Tunnel Model and the Flexi-grid Media
   Channel Model.

   The WSON Tunnel Model, or the Flexi-grid Media Channel Model, may be
   used to setup connectivity within the DWDM network depending on
   whether the DWDM optical network is based on fixed grid or flexible-
   grid.

   The Ethernet Client Signal Model is used to configure the steering
   of the Ethernet client traffic between Ethernet access links and TE
   Tunnels, which in this case could be either WSON Tunnels or
   Flexi-Grid Media Channels. This model is generic and applies to any
   technology-specific TE Tunnel: technology-specific attributes are
   provided by the technology-specific models which augment the generic
   TE-Tunnel Model.

3.2.3. YANG data models at the Packet MPIs

   The Packet PNC also uses at least the following technology-specific
   topology YANG models, providing IP and Ethernet technology-specific
   augmentations of the generic Topology Models described in section
   3.2.1:

   o  The L3 Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-l3-unicast-topology"
      YANG module of [RFC8346], which augments the Base Network
      Topology Model;

   o  The L3 specific data model including extended TE attributes (e.g.
      performance derived metrics like latency), defined in "ietf-l3-
      te-topology" and in "ietf-te-topology-packet" YANG modules of
      [L3-TE-TOPO];

   o  When SR-TE is used, the SR Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-
      sr-mpls-topology" YANG module of [SR-TE-TOPO]: this YANG module
      is used together with other YANG modules to provide the SR-TE
      topology view as described in figure 2 of [SR-TE-TOPO];

   o  The Ethernet Topology Model, defined in the "ietf-eth-te-
      topology" YANG module of [CLIENT-TOPO], which augments the TE
      Topology Model.

   The Ethernet Topology Model is used to report the cross-layer links
   between the IP routers and the edge ROADMs as well as the
   inter-domain links between ASBRs, while the L3 Topology Model is
   used to report the IP network topology (e.g., IP routers and links).

   (PCE) [RFC5440] and PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to the ACTN
   framework. It further describes how the PCE architecture applies to
   ACTN and lists the PCEP extensions that are needed to use PCEP as an
   ACTN interface.  The stateful PCE [RFC8231], PCE-Initiation
   [RFC8281], stateful Hierarchical PCE (H-PCE) [RFC8751], and PCE as a
   central controller (PCECC) [RFC8283] are some of the key extensions
   that enable the use of PCE/PCEP for ACTN.

   Since the PCEP supports path computation in the packet and optical
   networks, PCEP is well suited for inter-layer path computation.
   [RFC5623] describes a framework for applying the PCE-based
   architecture to interlayer (G)MPLS traffic engineering. Furthermore,
   the section 6.1 of [RFC8751] states the H-PCE applicability for
   inter-layer or POI.

   [RFC8637] lists various PCEP extensions that apply to ACTN. It also
   list the PCEP extension for optical network and POI.

   Note that the PCEP can be used in conjunction with the YANG models
   described in the rest of this document. Depending on whether ACTN is
   deployed in a greenfield or brownfield, two options are possible:

   1. The MDSC uses a single RESTCONF/YANG interface towards each PNC
      to discover all the TE information and request TE tunnels. It may
      either perform full multi-layer path computation or delegate path
      computation to the underneath PNCs.

      This approach is desirable for operators from an multi-vendor
      integration perspective as it is simple, and we need only one
      type of interface (RESTCONF) and use the relevant YANG data
      models depending on the operator use case considered. Benefits of
      having only one protocol for the MPI between MDSC and PNC have
      been already highlighted in [PATH-COMPUTE].

   2. The MDSC uses the RESTCONF/YANG interface towards each PNC to
      discover all the TE information and requests the creation of TE
      tunnels. However, it uses PCEP for hierarchical path computation.

      As mentioned in Option 1, from an operator perspective, this
      option can add integration complexity to have two protocols
      instead of one, unless the RESTOCONF/YANG interface is added to
      an existing PCEP deployment (brownfield scenario).

   Section 4 of this draft analyses the case where a single
   RESTCONF/YANG interface is deployed at the MPI (i.e., option 1
   above).

4. Multi-layer and multi-domain services scenarios

   Multi-layer and multi-domain scenarios, based on reference network
   described in section 2, and very relevant for Service Providers, are
   described in the next sections. For each scenario, existing IETF
   protocols and data models are identified with particular focus on
   the MPI in the ACTN architecture. Non-ACTN IETF data models required
   for L2/L3VPN service provisioning between MDSC and packet PNCs are
   also identified.

4.1. Scenario 1: inventory, service and network topology discovery

   In this scenario, the MSDC needs to discover through the underlying
   PNCs, the network topology, at both WDM and IP layers, in terms of
   nodes and links, including inter-AS domain links as well as cross-
   layer links but also in terms of tunnels (MPLS or SR paths in IP
   layer and OCh and optionally ODUk tunnels in optical layer).

   In addition, the MDSC should discover the IP/MPLS transport services
   (L2VPN/L3VPN) deployed, both intra-domain and inter-domain wise.

   The O-PNC and P-PNC could discover and report the inventory
   information of their equipment that is used by the different
   management layers. In the context of POI, the inventory information
   of IP and WDM equipment can complement the topology views and
   facilitate the IP-Optical multi-layer view.

   The MDSC could also discover the whole inventory information of both
   IP and WDM equipment and correlate this information with the links
   reported in the network topology.

   Each PNC provides to the MDSC an abstracted or full topology view of
   the WDM or the IP topology of the domain it controls. This topology
   can be abstracted in the sense that some detailed NE information is
   hidden at the MPI. All or some of the NEs and related physical links
   are exposed as abstract nodes and logical (virtual) links, depending
   on the level of abstraction the user requires. This information is
   key to understanding both the inter-AS domain links (seen by each
   controller as UNI interfaces but as I-NNI interfaces by the MDSC)
   and the cross-layer mapping between IP and WDM layer.

   The MDSC should also maintain up-to-date inventory, service and
   network topology databases of both IP and WDM layers (and optionally
   OTN layer) through the use of IETF notifications through MPI with
   the PNCs when any inventory/topology/service change occurs.

   It should be possible also to correlate information coming from IP
   and WDM layers (e.g., which port, lambda/OTSi, and direction, is
   used by a specific IP service on the WDM equipment).

   In particular, for the cross-layer links, it is key for MDSC to
   automatically correlate the information from the PNC network
   databases about the physical ports from the routers (single link or
   bundle links for LAG) to client ports in the ROADM.

  It should be possible at MDSC level to easily correlate WDM and IP
  layers alarms to speed-up troubleshooting

  Alarms and event notifications are required between MDSC and PNCs so
  that any network changes are reported almost in real-time to the MDSC
  (e.g. NE or link failure, MPLS tunnel switched from primary to back-
  up path etc.). As specified in [RFC7923], MDSC must subscribe to
  specific objects from PNC YANG datastores for notifications.

4.1.1. Inter-domain link discovery

   In the reference network of Figure 1, there are two types of
   inter-domain links:

   o  Inter-domain links between two IP domains (ASes)

   o  Cross-layer links between an IP router and a ROADM

   Both types of links are Ethernet physical links.

   The inter-domain link information is reported to the MDSC by the two
   adjacent PNCs, controlling the two ends of the inter-domain link.
   The MDSC needs to understand how to merge these inter-domain
   Ethernet links together.

   This document considers the following two options for discovering
   inter-domain links:

   1. Static configuration

   2. LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] automatic discovery

   Other options are possible but not described in this document.

   The MDSC can understand how to merge these inter-domain links using
   the plug-id attribute defined in the TE Topology Model [RFC8795], as
   described in section 4.3 of [RFC8795].

   A more detailed description of how the plug-id can be used to
   discover inter-domain links is also provided in section 5.1.4 of
   [TNBI].

   Both types of inter-domain links are discovered using the plug-id
   attributes reported in the Ethernet Topologies exposed by the two
   adjacent PNCs. In addition, the MDSC can also discover an
   inter-domain IP link/adjacency between the two IP LTPs, reported in
   the IP Topologies exposed by the two adjacent P-PNCs, supported by
   the two ETH LTPs of an Ethernet link discovered between these two
   P-PNCs.

   The static configuration requires an administrative burden to
   configure network-wide unique identifiers: it is therefore more
   viable for inter-AS links. For the cross-layer links between the IP
   routers and the Optical NEs, the automatic discovery solution based

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                    January 2022


   on LLDP snooping is preferable when LLDP snooping is supported by
   the Optical NEs.

   As outlined in [TNBI], the encoding of the plug-id namespace and the
   LLDP information within the plug-id value is implementation specific
   and needs to be consistent across all the PNCs.

4.1.2. Multi-layer IP link discovery

   All the intra-domain IP links are discovered by P-PNC, using LLDP
   [IEEE 802.1AB] or any other mechanisms which are outside the scope
   of this document, and reported at the MPI within the L3 Topology.

   In case of a multi-layer IP link, the P-PNC also reports the two
   inter-domain ETH LTPs that supports the two IP LTPs terminating the
   multi-layer IP link.

   The MDSC can therefore discover which Ethernet access link supports
   the multi-layer IP link as described in section 4.1.1.

   The Optical Transponders, or the OTN access cards, are reported by
   the O-PNC as Trail Termination Points (TTPs), defined in [RFC8795],
   within the Optical Topology. The association between the Ethernet
   access link and the Optical TTP is reported using the Inter Layer
   Lock (ILL) identifiers, defined in [RFC8795], within the Ethernet
   Topology and Optical Topology, exposed by the O-PNC.

   The MDSC can discover throught the MPI the Optical Tunnels being
   setup by each O-PNC and in particular which Optical Tunnel has been
   setup between the two TTPs associated with the two Ethernet access
   links supporting an inter-domain IP link.

4.1.3. Inventory discovery

   The are no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to report at
   the MPI the whole inventory information discovered by a PNC.

   [RFC8345] has foreseen some work for inventory as an augmentation of
   the network model, but no YANG data model has been developed so far.

   There are also no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to
   correlate topology information, e.g., a link termination point
   (LTP), with inventory information, e.g., the physical port
   supporting an LTP, if any.

   Inventory information through MPI and correlation with topology
   information is identified as a gap requiring further work and
   outside of the scope of this draft.

4.1.4. SR-TE paths discovery

   This version of the draft assumes that discovery of existing SR-TE
   paths, including their bandwidth, at the MPI is done using the
   generic TE tunnel YANG data model, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with
   SR-TE specific augmentations, as also outlined in section 1 of
   [TE-TUNNEL].

   To enable MDSC to discover the full end-to-end SR-TE path
   configuration, the SR-TE specific augmentation of the [TE-TUNNEL]
   should allow the P-PNC to report the SID list assigned to an SR-TE
   path within its domain.

   [Editors' note:] Need to check if SR-TE specific augmentation is
   required for SR-TE path discovery

   For example, considering the L3VPN in Figure 4, the PE13-P16-PE14
   SR-TE path and the SR-TE path in the reverse direction (between PE14
   and PE13) could be reported by the P-PNC1 to the MDSC as TE paths of
   the same TE tunnel instance. The bandwidth of these TE paths
   represents the bandwidth allocated by P-PNC1 to the two SR-TE
   paths,which can be symmetric or asymmetric in the two directions.

4.2. Establishment of L2VPN/L3VPN with TE requirements

   In this scenario the MDSC needs to setup a multi-domain L2VPN or a
   L3VPN with some SLA requirements.

   Figure 4 provides an example of an hub&spoke L3VPN with three PEs
   where the hub PE (PE13) and one spoke PE (PE14) are within the same
   packet domain and the other spoke PE (PE23) is within a different
   packet domain.

   There are many options to implement multi-domain L3VPN, including:

     1. BGP-LU (seamless MPLS)
     2. Inter-domain RSVP-TE
     3. Inter-domain SR-TE

   This version of the draft provides an analysis of the inter-domain
   SR-TE option. A future update of this draft will provide a high-
   level analysis of the BGP-LU option.

   It is assumed that each packet domain in Figure 4 is implementing
   SR-TE and the stitching between two domains is done using end-to-
   end/multi-domain SR-TE. It is assumed that the bandwidth of each
   intra-domain SR-TE path is managed by its respective P-PNC and that
   binding SID is used for the end-to-end SR-TE path stitching. It is
   assumed that each packet domain in Figure 4 is using TI-LFA, with
   SRLG awareness, for local protection within each domain.

   [Editor's note:] Analyze how TI-LFA can take into account multi-
   layer SRLG disjointness, providing that SRLG information is provided
   by the O-PNCs to the P-PNC throught the MDSC.

   It is assumed that the MDSC adopts the partial summarization model,
   described in section 2.2, having full visibility of the packet layer
   TE topology and an abstract view of the underlay optical layer TE
   topology.

   The MDSC needs to translate the L3VPN SLA requirements to TE
   requirements (e.g., bandwidth, TE metric bounds, SRLG disjointness,
   nodes/links/domains inclusion/exclusion) and find the SR-TE paths
   between PE13 (hub PE) and, respectively, PE23 and PE14 (spoke PEs)
   that meet these TE requirements.

   For each SR-TE path required to support the L3VPN, it is possible
   that:

   1. A SR-TE path that meets the TE requirements already exist in the
      network.

   2. An existing SR-TE path could be modified (e.g., through bandwidth
      increase) to meet the TE requirements:

       a. The SR-TE path characteristics can be modified only in the
          packet layer.

       b. One or more new underlay Optical tunnels need to be setup to
          support the requested changes of the overlay SR-TE paths
          (multi-layer coordination is required).

   3. A new SR-TE path needs to be setup:

       a. The new SR-TE path reuses existing underlay optical tunnels;

       b. One or more new underlay Optical tunnels need to be setup to
          support the setup of the new SR-TE path  (multi-layer
          coordination is required).

   For example, considering the L3VPN in Figure 4, the MDSC discovers
   that:

   o  a PE13-P16-PE14 SR-TE path already exists but have not enough
      bandwidth to support the new L3VPN, as described in section
      4.1.4;

   o  the IP link(s) between P16 and PE14 has not enough bandwidth to
      support increasing the bandwidth of that SR-TE path, as described
      in section 4.1;

   o  a new underlay optical tunnel could be setup to increase the
      bandwidth IP link(s) between P16 and PE14 to support increasing
      the bandwidth of that overlay SR-TE path, as described in section
      4.2.1. The dimensioning of the underlay optical tunnel is decided
      by the MDSC based on the bandwidth requested by the SR-TE path
      and on its multi-layer optimization policy, which is an internal
      MDSC implementation issue.

   The MDSC would therefore request:

   o  the O-PNC1 to setup a new optical tunnel between the ROADMs
      connected to P16 and PE14, as described in section 4.2.2;

   o  the P-PNC1 to update the configuration of the existing IP link,
      in case of LAG, or configure a new IP link, in case of ECMP,
      between P16 and PE14, as described in section 4.2.2;

   o  the P-PNC1 to update the bandwidth of the selected SR-TE path
      between PE13 and PE14, as described in section 4.2.3.

   For example, considering the L3VPN in Figure 4, the MDSC can also
   decide that a new multi-domain SR-TE path needs to be setup between
   PE13 and PE23.

   As described in section 2.2, with partial summarization, the MDSC
   will use the TE topology information provided by the P-PNCs and the
   results of the path computation requests sent to the O-PNCs, as
   described in section 4.2.1, to compute the multi-layer/multi-domain
   path between PE13 and PE23.

   For example, the multi-layer/multi-domain performed by the MDSC
   could require the setup of:

   o  a new underlay optical tunnel between PE13 and BR11, supporting a
      new IP link, as described in section 4.2.2;

   o  a new underlay optical tunnel between BR21 and P24 to increase
      the bandwidth of the IP link(s) between BR21 and P24, as
      described in section 4.2.2.

   After that, the MDSC requests P-PNC2 to setup an SR-TE path between
   BR21 and PE23, with an explicit path (BR21, P24, PE23) as described
   in section 4.2.3. The P-PNC2, knowing the node and the adjacency
   SIDs assigned within its domain, can install the proper SR policy,
   or hierarchical policies, within BR21 and returns to the MDSC the
   assigned binding SID.

   [Editor's Note] Further investigation is needed for the SR specific
   extensions to the TE tunnel model.

   MDSC request P-PNC1 to setup an SR-TE path between PE13 and BR11,
   with an explicit path (PE13, BR11), specifying the inter-domain link
   toward BR21 and the binding SID to be used for the end-to-end SR-TE
   path stitching, as described in section 4.2.3. The P-PNC1, knowing
   also the node and the adjacency SIDs assigned within its domain and
   the EPE SID assigned by BR11 to the inter-domain link toward BR21,
   installs the proper policy, or policies, within PE13.

   Once the SR-TE paths have been selected and, if needed,
   setup/modified, the MDSC can request to both P-PNCs to configure the
   L3VPN and its binding with the selected SR-TE paths using the [L3NM]
   and [TSM] YANG models.

   [Editor's Note] Further investigation is needed to understand how
   the binding between a L3VPN and this new end-to-end SR-TE path can
   be configured.

4.2.1. Optical Path Computation

   As described in section 2.2, the optical path computation is usually
   performed by the Optical PNC.

   When performing multi-layer/multi-domain path computation, the MDSC
   can delegate the Optical PNCs for single-domain optical path
   computation.

   As discussed in [PATH-COMPUTE], there are two options to request an
   Optical PNC to perform optical path computation: either via a
   "compute-only" TE tunnel path, using the generic TE tunnel YANG data
   model defined in [TE-TUNNEL] or via the path computation RPC defined
   in [PATH-COMPUTE].

   This draft assumes that the path computation RPC is used.

   The are no YANG data models in IETF that could be used to augment
   the generic path computation RPC with technology-specific
   attributes.

   Optical technology-specific augmentation for the path computation
   RPC is identified as a gap requiring further work outside of this
   draft's scope.

4.2.2. Multi-layer IP link Setup and Update

   The MDSC requires the O-PNC to setup an Optical Tunnel (either a
   WSON Tunnel or a Flexi-grid Tunnel or an OTN Tunnel) within the
   Optical network between the two Optical Transponders (OTs), in case
   of DWDM network, or the two OTN access cards, in case of OTN
   networks, associated with the two access links.

   The MDSC also requires the O-PNC to steer the Ethernet client
   traffic between the two access Ethernet links over the Optical
   Tunnel.

   After the Optical Tunnel has been setup and the client traffic
   steering configured, the two IP routers can exchange Ethernet
   packets between themselves, including LLDP messages.

   If LLDP [IEEE 802.1AB] is used between the two routers, the P- PNC
   can automatically discover the IP link being set up by the MDSC. The
   IP LTPs terminating this IP link are supported by the ETH LTPs
   terminating the two access links.

   Otherwise, the MDSC needs to require the P-PNC to configure an IP
   link between the two routers: the MDSC also configures the two ETH
   LTPs which support the two IP LTPs terminating this IP link.

   [Editor's Note] Add text for IP link update and clarify that the IP
   link bandwidth increase can be done either by LAG or by ECMP. Both
   options are valid and widely deployed and more or less the same from
   POI perspective.

4.2.3. SR-TE Path Setup and Update

   This version of the draft assumes that SR-TE path setup and update
   at the MPI could be done using the generic TE tunnel YANG data
   model, defined in [TE-TUNNEL], with SR TE specific augmentations, as
   also outlined in section 1 of [TE-TUNNEL].

   The MDSC can use the [TE-TUNNEL] model to request the P-PNC to setup
   TE paths specifying the explicit path to force the P-PNC to setup
   the actual path being computed by MDSC.

   The [TE-TUNNEL] model supports requesting the setup of both end-
   to-end as well as segment TE paths (within one domain).

   In the latter case, SR-TE specific augmentations of the [TE-TUNNEL]
   model should be defined to allow the MDSC to configure the binding
   SIDs to be used for the end to-end SR-TE path stitching and to allow
   the P-PNC to report the binding SID assigned to the segment TE
   paths.

   The assigned binding SID should be persistent in case router or P-
   PNC rebooting.

   The MDSC can also use the [TE-TUNNEL] model to request the P-PNC to
   increase the bandwidth allocated to an existing TE path, and, if
   needed, also on its reverse TE path. The [TE-TUNNEL] model supports
   both symmetric and asymmetric bandwidth configuration in the two
   directions.

   SR-TE path setup and update (e.g., bandwidth increase) through MPI
   is identified as a gap requiring further work, which is outside of
   the scope of this draft.

5. Security Considerations

   Several security considerations have been identified and will be
   discussed in future versions of this document.

6. Operational Considerations

   Telemetry data, such as collecting lower-layer networking health and
   consideration of network and service performance from POI domain
   controllers, may be required. These requirements and capabilities
   will be discussed in future versions of this document.

7. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.

Appendix A. Multi-layer and multi-domain resiliency

A.1.  Maintenance Window

   Before planned maintenance operation on DWDM network takes place, IP
   traffic should be moved hitless to another link.

   MDSC must reroute IP traffic before the events takes place. It
   should be possible to lock IP traffic to the protection route until
   the maintenance event is finished, unless a fault occurs on such
   path.

A.2.  Router port failure

   The focus is on client-side protection scheme between IP router and
   reconfigurable ROADM. Scenario here is to define only one port in
   the routers and in the ROADM muxponder board at both ends as back-up
   ports to recover any other port failure on client-side of the ROADM
   (either on router port side or on muxponder side or on the link
   between them). When client-side port failure occurs, alarms are
   raised to MDSC by IP-PNC and O-PNC (port status down, LOS etc.).
   MDSC checks with OP-PNC(s) that there is no optical failure in the
   optical layer.

   There can be two cases here:

   a) LAG was defined between the two end routers. MDSC, after checking
      that optical layer is fine between the two end ROADMs, triggers
      the ROADM configuration so that the router back-up port with its
      associated muxponder port can reuse the OCh that was already in
      use previously by the failed router port and adds the new link to
      the LAG on the failure side.

      While the ROADM reconfiguration takes place, IP/MPLS traffic is
      using the reduced bandwidth of the IP link bundle, discarding
      lower priority traffic if required. Once back-up port has been
      reconfigured to reuse the existing OCh and new link has been
      added to the LAG then original Bandwidth is recovered between the
      end routers.

      Note: in this LAG scenario let assume that BFD is running at LAG
      level so that there is nothing triggered at MPLS level when one
      of the link member of the LAG fails.

Internet-Draft                 ACTN POI                    January 2022


   b) If there is no LAG then the scenario is not clear since a router
      port failure would automatically trigger (through BFD failure)
      first a sub-50ms protection at MPLS level :FRR (MPLS RSVP-TE
      case) or TI-LFA (MPLS based SR-TE case) through a protection
      port. At the same time MDSC, after checking that optical network
      connection is still fine, would trigger the reconfiguration of
      the back-up port of the router and of the ROADM muxponder to re-
      use the same OCh as the one used originally for the failed router
      port. Once everything has been correctly configured, MDSC Global
      PCE could suggest to the operator to trigger a possible re-
      optimization of the back-up MPLS path to go back to the  MPLS
      primary path through the back-up port of the router and the
      original OCh if overall cost, latency etc. is improved. However,
      in this scenario, there is a need for protection port PLUS back-
      up port in the router which does not lead to clear port savings.
